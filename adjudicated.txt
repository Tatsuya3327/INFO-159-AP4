10	adjudicated	pos	Place the almonds in a large bowl and cover with water. Soak at least 4 hours, up to 2 days. Overnight is ideal. Drain the almonds and place them in a blender with the remaining ingredients. Puree until the almonds are in tiny pieces. Discard the soaking liquid and use new filtered water for pureeing. Place a strainer in a large bowl and cover the top of the strainer with cheesecloth (this step is important because the almonds will be in such small pieces that the cheesecloth and strainer need to stop them from going into the milk). Pour the almond milk through the cheesecloth. You may need to do this in stages so the milk can slowly strain through the cheesecloth. It may help taking a spoon to scrape the bottom of the cheesecloth so the milk can pass. Pour the milk and the almond puree into separate containers and refrigerate until ready to drink." the pureed almonds can be saved and eaten as a breakfast with typical oatmeal toppings, or as a dessert topped with fresh berries!
11	adjudicated	pos	Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large saucepan over medium-high. Add shrimp heads and shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until shells and oil are bright red and shells are very fragrant, 5–8 minutes. Use a potato masher to press down very firmly on heads to release their juices. Stir in tomato paste and cook until it starts to brown and stick to bottom of pot, about 1 minute. Add 1/3 cup wine and cook, scraping up brown bits, until almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add carrot, celery, thyme sprigs, peppercorns, 2 onion halves, all but 4 garlic cloves, and 8 cups water. Toss in a generous pinch of salt and bring to a boil over medium-high. Reduce heat and simmer until stock is reduced by one-quarter and very fragrant, 60–70 minutes. While stock is simmering, finely chop remaining onion and garlic cloves. Remove stock from heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium saucepan; discard solids. (You should have about 6 cups.) Taste and season lightly with salt. Keep warm over low heat. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add chopped onion and garlic and cook, stirring often, until onion is translucent and softened, about 5 minutes (do not let it take on any color). Add rice and cook, stirring often, until grains are almost entirely translucent and starting to stick to bottom of pot, about 3 minutes. Stir in remaining 1/3 cup wine and cook, stirring, until wine is almost completely evaporated. Ladle in about 1 cup warm stock and cook, stirring, until liquid is absorbed. Repeat process, adding more stock as each addition is absorbed, until rice is tender but not mushy, 25–30 minutes. The risotto should be loose, creamy, and saucy, but thick enough that you can see bottom of pot when stirring; if you run out of stock before rice is tender, add water 1/4-cupful at a time until rice is cooked and desired consistency is achieved. Season risotto with salt and pepper and stir in shrimp. Cook, stirring, until shrimp are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and finely grate in lemon zest. Add butter and 4 oz. mascarpone and stir until incorporated. Spoon risotto onto warmed plates and dollop remaining mascarpone; top with chives. Cut lemon into wedges and serve alongside for squeezing over. Stock can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill, or freeze 1 month ahead.
12	adjudicated	pos	1. Make the croutons: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Brush both sides of bread slices with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Cut into 1-inch cubes and bake croutons in oven on a baking sheet, shaking pan occasionally, until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. 2. Remove salmon skin from fillet and reserve fillet for another use. Lightly brush half tablespoon hazelnut oil on both sides of salmon skin and place on preheated grill until crispy, about 2 minutes per side. (Alternatively, you can crisp it under a broiler.) Pat salmon skin dry with paper towels, cut into three-quarter-inch dice, and set aside. 3. Combine shallots, lemon juice, sherry vinegar, ginger, garlic, half cup of hazelnut oil, salt and pepper in a small saucepan and cook the dressing over moderate heat until shallots are wilted, about 3 to 4 minutes. 4. In a large bowl toss the frisee, salmon skin, and croutons with warm sherry vinegar dressing. Divide among 6 plates and serve immediately.
13	adjudicated	pos	Preheat the oven to 425°F. Using a small paring knife, make a few ½-inch slits into the cut side of each eggplant. (You can do this lengthwise, crosswise, or even diagonally. Knock yourself out with your decorative prowess!) Place the eggplant cut side up on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with ½ cup olive oil, distributing as evenly as possible. Season with salt and pepper and turn over so that the eggplant is cut side down. Place in the oven and roast, without moving or disturbing, until eggplant is completely tender, cooked through, and golden brown on the bottom (since the skin is already so dark, it can be hard to tell, but the skin will look shriveled and, when poked, the whole thing should feel tender, on the verge of collapse; you can also use a spatula to lift up the eggplant to check the underside for color), 40 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining ¼ cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and chile and cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, until the garlic and chile are frizzled and fragrant (but not yet browned), 1 or 2 minutes. Add the bread and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the bread is evenly toasted and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Combine the labne, preserved lemon, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice in a small bowl; season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if you like. Smear it onto the bottom of a large serving platter or in a shallow bowl. Once the eggplant is good and ready to go, use a fish spatula (or regular spatula) to lift up each eggplant half in one fell swoop, preserving its lovely golden underside. Place the eggplant, cut side up, on top of the seasoned labne. Scatter with the crispy croutons and herbs before serving. Eggplant can be roasted a few hours ahead, then kept loosely covered at room temperature (no need to reheat— it’s excellent at room temperature). The labne can be seasoned a week ahead, covered tightly, and refrigerated. The croutons can be made 2 days ahead, kept covered tightly at room temperature.
14	adjudicated	pos	Heat oil in a medium heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high. Add cumin, garlic powder, cinnamon, turmeric, and cayenne and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Meanwhile, cook couscous according to package directions; season with remaining 1/4 tsp. salt. Divide couscous among plates. Spoon tagine over and top with pistachios.
15	adjudicated	pos	1 To make the filling, place the chicken breasts and onion in a medium saucepan and add enough cold water to cover by 1 inch. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the saucepan and let cool completely. Tear the chicken into shreds. 2 Mash the avocado, mayonnaise, and vinegar together in a medium bowl with an immersion blender or large fork until smooth. Stir in the cilantro, parsley, jalapeno, and garlic. Add the chicken, red pepper, red onion, and scallion and mix together. Season with salt and pepper. Taste and add more vinegar to give the filling a pleasant, but not sour, tang. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. 3 To make the arepas, stir 3 cups lukewarm water and the salt together in a large bowl to dissolve the salt. Gradually add 3 cups cornmeal, mixing with your fingers to dissolve any lumps, adding enough to make a soft dough that holds its shape without cracking when molded. Set dough aside to rest for 3 minutes. Add the oil and work it in with your hands, adding cornmeal or water to return the dough to the proper consistency. 4 Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Shape each into a 4-inch diameter disk, about 1 inch thick. Transfer to a baking sheet. 5 Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly oil a large nonstick skillet or griddle and heat over medium heat. 6 In batches, place the arepas in the skillet. Cook until the underside is a splotchy golden brown, about 4 minutes. Turn and brown the other side. Return arepas to the baking sheet. 7 When all of the arepas are browned, transfer them directly to the oven rack (without the baking sheet). Bake until the surfaces of the arepas have formed a taut skin-if you rap your fingers on one, it will feel and sound like a drum. Return arepas to the baking sheet and let cool slightly. Split each arepa in half and fill with the chicken mixture. Serve warm.

Stuff with one-third of grapefruit slices, lemon slices, dill sprigs, and tarragon sprigs. Mix 10 cups salt and 1 1/2 cups water in a large bowl, adding more water as needed, until mixture is the texture of wet sand. Spread a thin layer of salt mixture on a rimmed baking sheet roughly the same shape and size as fish. Top salt mixture with another third of grapefruit and lemon slices and dill and tarragon sprigs; set salmon on salt bed and top with remaining citrus and herbs. Pack remaining salt mixture over fish, leaving head and tail peeking out. Roast salmon until just cooked through (poke a paring knife or metal skewer though the salt and into the flesh; it should feel warm to the touch when removed), 40–50 minutes. While salmon is cooking, simmer shallot and wine in a small saucepan until only 2 tablespoons liquid remains, 8–10 minutes. Whisking constantly, add butter a piece at a time, incorporating completely before adding the next piece, to make a glossy, emulsified sauce. Whisk crème fraîche, grapefruit zest, grapefruit juice, lemon zest, and 1 teaspoon lemon juice into sauce; season with salt. Reduce heat to low and keep sauce warm while you finish the dish. Remove salmon from oven and using a knife or the edge of a fish spatula, crack salt crust and remove (it should come off in large pieces); let salmon sit 5 minutes before serving. Meanwhile, toss parsley, dill, tarragon, capers, caraway seeds, and remaining 2 teaspoons lemon juice in a medium bowl; season herb salad with salt. Serve salmon with beurre blanc and herb salad.

Lightly dust dough with flour to prevent a crust from forming. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled in bulk, 2 to 3 hours. Stir down dough with rubber spatula and lightly dust with flour (dough will still be very sticky). Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough, stirring it again after the first hour, at least 12 hours. Generously brush softened butter over bottom and up sides of ring mold. Using rubber spatula, scrape dough onto a well-floured surface and dust dough with flour. Roll out dough into a 10 1/2-inch disk (about 1/2 inch thick) with a well-floured rolling pin. Cut out 20 rounds (as close together as possible) with floured cutter. Gather scraps and knead once or twice, then roll out into a 5 1/2-inch disk (1/2 inch thick) and chill disk, wrapped in plastic wrap. Flatten 2 (2-inch) rounds of dough to 2 1/2 inches wide with floured fingertips. Make an indentation in center of 1 flattened round with your thumb, and place 1 level teaspoon jam in indentation, keeping edge of round clean. Cover with remaining flattened round and gently pinch edges using floured fingers to seal completely. Gently roll between floured palms to smooth seams and form a round pouch. Repeat with remaining rounds. (If rounds become too soft to work with, chill on a plate, covered.) Cut out 8 more rounds from chilled disk and make 4 more pouches in same manner for a total of 14 filled pouches. Brush tops of pouches with some melted butter. With floured fingers, carefully invert 7 pouches (buttered side down) into bottom of ring mold, evenly spaced and barely touching. Brush pouches with more butter and sprinkle pecans evenly on top. Make another layer with remaining 7 pouches, placing each pouch over an area where edges of pouches underneath meet (covering gaps). Brush with remaining melted butter. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until pouches double in bulk, 1 to 2 hours (they will rise slightly above edge of ring mold). Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Carefully remove plastic wrap and put ring mold on a baking sheet, then bake until top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Invert onto a rack and remove ring mold. Cool to warm, 20 to 30 minutes, or room temperature. Turn right side up just before serving.

Add the chicken and turn to coat fully in the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator about 45 minutes before frying. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. In a large, shallow bowl, combine the flour, remaining 1 tablespoon salt, Cajun seasoning, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and roll it around in the seasoned flour until completely covered. Set it on the prepared baking sheet; repeat with the remaining chicken. Dip the coated chicken pieces once more in the marinade, then again in flour. Return the pieces to the baking sheet (a few minutes' rest makes for a sturdier, crisper coating). Have a wire cooling rack set over paper towels ready. In a large, heavy Dutch oven, heat 1 1/2 inches of oil over medium heat until it reaches 350°F on a deep-fat thermometer. Using kitchen tongs, add a few chicken pieces at a time to the hot oil (crowding will lower the temperature, making for greasy chicken). Fry the chicken until the internal temperature reaches 180°F, about 10 minutes per side (watch carefully, it can easily burn). Transfer the cooked chicken to the wire rack. Serve immediately or at room temperature (don't let the chicken sit more than 2 hours). The chicken can be fried up to 2 days in advance, covered, and refrigerated. Serve it cold-a classic Texas picnic food-or reheat on wire racks set on baking sheets in a 375°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes. If the chicken looks pretty dark before it is cooked through, transfer to wire racks set on baking sheets and bake in a 375°F oven until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 180°F on an instant-read thermometer. Keep fried chicken warm in a 200°F oven. Using a digital thermometer eliminates the need to stand over the chicken. When the alarm sounds, the meat is done.

63	adjudicated	pos	Cover mushrooms with hot water by 1 inch in a bowl and soak 20 minutes (mushrooms will expand). Drain in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse thoroughly, then drain again. Trim off and discard any hard parts from mushrooms, then finely chop. (You should have about 3 tablespoons.) Stir together mushrooms, pork, crabmeat, beaten whole egg, cilantro, ginger, scallion, garlic, and salt in a bowl until combined well. Line a tray with wax paper. Put a double thickness of paper towels on a work surface and fill a shallow baking pan with warm water. Discard any rice-paper wedges with holes. Soak 1 wedge in warm water until pliable, 30 seconds to 1 minute, then carefully transfer to paper towels, arranging it with curved side of wedge nearest you. Put 1 tablespoon filling in middle of curved side about 1/2 inch from edge and shape filling horizontally into a 2 3/4-inch log. Fold left and right corners of wedge over filling, overlapping slightly and aligning bottom edges. (Wedge will resemble an open envelope.) Dab top corner with some yolk, then tightly roll up wedge away from you, making sure ends stay tucked inside. (Be sure to roll up wedges tightly or air pockets will prevent rolls from browning evenly when fried.) Put roll, seam side down, on tray and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Make more rolls in same manner, transferring to tray and arranging 1/2 inch apart. Keep loosely covered until ready to fry. Heat about 1 inch of oil in a 5- to 6-quart pot over moderately high heat until it registers 365°F on thermometer. Fry rolls in batches of 5 or 6, keeping rolls apart during first minute of frying to prevent sticking and stirring occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer as fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. (Return oil to 365°F between batches.) *Found in Asian markets and adrianascaravan.com.
64	adjudicated	pos	1. Fillet the grapefruit by first cutting off the peel so that the citrus flesh is exposed. Then cut out the fillets by angling the knife and cutting by the natural partings. The fillets come out in half moon shapes. Cut the fillets into 1/2 inch pieces. 2. Peel and chop the red onion coarsely. Peel the avocado and cut into 1/2 inch cubes. Do the same with the salmon slices. 3. Mix all the ingredients in a plastic bowl or plastic bag. Let the mixture soak for at least an hour in the fridge. Serve the ceviche in shot glasses with a teaspoon. Ceviche tastes best cool, so serve the shot glasses on a deep tray filled with ice. This dish keeps well in the refrigerator and can be prepared up to twenty-four hours beforehand; the citrus juice ensures the avocado doesn't turn brown and dull. Make a more traditional ceviche by using raw fish, shrimp, or scallops. Use lime juice instead of grapefruit, and add chopped tomatoes and cilantro. Use white fish, such as cod or snapper. Always freeze the fish for at least 3 days before you use it to kill any possible parasites.

77	adjudicated	neg	1. Put the pepper, garlic, oregano, lime and orange juices, and olive oil in a large nonreactive mixing bowl and whisk until the marinade emulsifies. Pour the marinade into a large zip-lock bag and add the steak, shaking until the meat gets well coated. (You can also put the steak directly in the mixing bowl, but you'll want to turn it at least once while the meat is marinating.) Refrigerate for at least 2 hours but no longer than overnight. When you're ready to start cooking, remove the steak from the marinade, pat dry, and let the meat come to room temperature. 2. Preheat an outdoor grill over a medium-high flame and brush the grates of the grill with oil so the meat doesn't stick. (You can also broil the meat in the oven.) 3. Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper and grill (or broil) for about 7 minutes per side. I like mine medium-rare. If you don't, grill (or broil) about 2 minutes more. 4. Remove the steak from the heat and let it rest on a cutting board for about 5 minutes, then slice it diagonally against the grain. 5. Warm up your tortillas. Get your rice, beans, and guacamole ready, and you're good to go.
78	adjudicated	pos	Preheat the oven to 350°F. Using a vegetable peeler, slice the asparagus lengthwise into long, thin strips, starting just under the tip of each stalk. Leave the tips whole. (Alternatively, cut the asparagus into 1-inch pieces.) In a pot with a steamer insert or in a covered sauté pan fitted with an expandable steamer basket, bring 2 inches of water to a boil. Add the asparagus to the steamer insert or basket, cover, and steam until tender, about 30 seconds for strips and about 3 minutes for pieces. Rinse the asparagus under cold water to stop the cooking. Drain well and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, garlic salt, and pepper. Stir in the Fontina, Gruyère, and reserved asparagus. Pour the mixture into the unbaked pie shell. Bake until lightly golden and set in the center when the pan is gently pushed, 40 to 45 minutes. If the crust is browning too quickly, cover it with foil to prevent it from burning. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Cut into 6 or 8 slices and serve warm or at room temperature. The quiche is best served the day it is made. Tightly wrap leftovers with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
79	adjudicated	pos	Wipe the grill grates with oil to prevent sticking. Build a two-zone fire. Your high-heat zone should have embers 1 to 2 inches from the cooking surface, with occasional flames licking it. To create your medium-heat zone, nudge the embers 2 to 3 inches lower than that. Fill a stockpot with the water, garlic, ginger, star anise, bay leaves, and peppercorns and place over medium heat. Place the chicken, carrots, celery, and onions over high heat and cook, turning occasionally, until well charred all over, about 15 minutes total. When each ingredient is done, add it to the pot (it’s important that each ingredient be very well browned—almost burnt—before adding to the pot). Cook the stock for at least 3 hours, adding additional water if necessary to keep the meat and vegetables covered. Season with salt at the end. Remove the pot from heat. Remove the chicken pieces and shred the meat, discarding the skin and bones. Strain the stock, discarding solids. To serve, place a pile of shredded chicken into each bowl and cover with hot stock. Pass the parsley and lemon wedges separately. The stock can be stored in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months.
80	adjudicated	pos	Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a 12-cup cupcake pan with paper liners. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of the flour, the baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a small saucepan, heat the milk and orange zest over low heat until hot (but not boiling); cool to lukewarm, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the vanilla. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium-low, add the egg and egg whites one at a time, and beat until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly add half the flour mixture, then the milk mixture, then the remaining flour mixture, beating until just blended after each addition. In a small bowl, toss the cranberries with the remaining 1 tablespoon flour. Using a silicone spatula, gently fold the cranberries into the batter. Divide the batter evenly among the liners and bake until the tops are just dry to the touch (some may be slightly golden on the sides before this happens) and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 17 to 19 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool completely before frosting with orange frosting. Butter two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper cut to fit, and butter the parchment. Flour the pans, coating the bottom and sides of each pan, then tap out the excess flour. Divide the batter between the two pans and bake until the tops are dry to the touch, the sides of the cake start to pull away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (for generally the same amount of time as in the cupcake recipe). Let cool on a wire rack, then remove each cake from its pan, discard the parchment paper, and set one cake layer on a cake round, frosting turntable, or the final serving platter. Frost the top of that cake layer with the frosting, stack the second layer on top, and frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and salt on medium speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low, gradually add the confectioners’ sugar, and beat until incorporated. Increase the speed to medium, add the milk, orange zest and juice, and vanilla and beat until fully blended, 1 to 2 minutes, making sure not to incorporate too much air into the frosting.
81	adjudicated	pos	Wash the rice by placing it in a large container and covering it with water. Agitate gently with your hand, then pour off the water. Repeat 5 times until the water is no longer cloudy. Drain, using a fine-mesh colander, and set aside. If using fresh fava beans in the pod, shell and remove second skins. If using frozen favas with second skins removed, place in a colander and rinse thoroughly. Set aside. Heat ¼ cup (60ml) oil in a large, non-stick pot over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the cinnamon stick, leek, and garlic, and stir-fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the leek is wilted. Add the rice, salt, pepper, turmeric, cardamom, and rose water, and stir-fry for another 1 minute. Add the water, tip in the skinned fava beans and bring back to a boil, stirring gently twice with a wooden spoon, to loosen any grains that may have stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cover firmly with a lid to prevent any steam from escaping. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed. Add the dill and fluff using 2 forks. Drizzle the remaining oil and the saffron-infused rose water over the rice. Cover again, reduce heat to low, and cook for another 10 minutes. Remove the pot from heat and allow to cool, still covered, for 5 minutes. Serve with fried eggs and Yogurt and Persian Shallot Dip or alongside roasted lamb or fish.

108	adjudicated	pos	Preheat oven to 300°F. Stack 2–3 sheets of foil ample enough to cover ham on a work surface and arrange pineapple and orange slices on top in a single layer. Set ham on fruit (if using a bone-in ham and it has a fat cap, score very lightly, making cuts about 3/4" apart) and wrap up tightly. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a large rimmed baking sheet and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of ham registers 115°F, 3–3 1/2 hours for boneless, 3 1/2–4 hours for bone-in. Meanwhile, bring pineapple juice, vinegar, brown sugar, and hot sauce to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce heat; simmer, swirling occasionally, until thick enough to coat a spoon. Keep warm. Remove ham from oven and increase oven temperature to 425°F. Unwrap ham, peeling back the foil so it covers the baking sheet (this will make for easy cleanup). Once oven is at 425°F, baste ham with warm glaze and return to oven. Bake, brushing with more glaze every 3 minutes or so, until glaze is deeply browned and thermometer registers 125°F, 12–15 minutes. Carefully transfer ham to a cutting board and let rest 30–60 minutes before slicing. While ham is resting, roast fruit, spooning juices over from time to time, until deeply browned, 20–25 minutes. Serve ham with roasted fruit and cherries alongside.

Add the jalapeños to the pot and stir well. Cook for 2 minutes, or until the jalapeños are charred. Line a plate with a paper towel and use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon and jalapeños to the plate. Set aside. Add the olive oil to the pot and increase the heat to high. Add the popcorn kernels and toss well to coat them in the oil. Spread the kernels evenly on the bottom of the pot, then cover the pot with the lid. When the first kernels start to pop, very slightly uncover the pot. Shake the pot back and forth directly over the heat. Cook until the kernels stop popping, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and pour the popcorn into a large bowl. Add the reserved bacon and jalapeños, the Parmesan, and the salt. Toss well to mix. Serve warm.
110	adjudicated	neg	Place a large strainer over a large bowl. Using the large holes of a box grater, grate some of the potatoes, followed by some of the onion, into the strainer. Repeat until all of the potatoes and onion are used up. (Alternating the potatoes and onion prevents the potatoes from discoloring.) Squeeze or press out as much of the liquid as possible. Allow the accumulated liquid to stand in another bowl for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour off the watery part but reserve the thick, starchy paste at the bottom. Transfer the potato-onion mixture to a clean large bowl. Add the starchy paste, egg yolks, scallions, potato fl our or matzo meal, butter, salt, pepper, and baking powder and mix well. In a separate medium bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until they hold stiff, shiny peaks. Fold the egg whites into the potato mixture. Heat a thin layer of oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Working in batches, scoop 1/4 cup of the potato mixture into the pan for each pancake. Flatten gently with a spatula.

Add one-quarter of beef and cook, turning once, until cooked through and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat in 3 batches with remaining oil and beef. Divide rice among bowls. Top with beef, Bibimbap Mix-Ins, and eggs. Serve kimchi alongside.
115	adjudicated	pos	Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toss pecans, maple syrup, and ½ tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Scrape onto a rimmed baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper and spread nuts into a single layer. Bake until pecans are slightly darkened and syrup is dark and bubbling, 15–20 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully toss pecans in hot syrup to coat again. Let cool on baking sheet until caramel hardens, about 30 minutes. Break up candied pecans into pieces; discard any burned bits. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F. Generously butter a 10" cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet; line bottom with a round of parchment paper and butter parchment. Pulse flour, brown sugar, half of candied pecans, and 1¼ tsp. salt in a food processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add egg, 1 Tbsp. vanilla, and remaining 10 Tbsp. butter and process until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer dough to a large bowl and knead a couple of times just to bring it together. Using damp hands, pat dough evenly into skillet, extending all the way to the sides of the pan. Bake cookie until edges are golden brown and center is slightly puffed, 30–35 minutes. Let cool in skillet 1 hour. Invert cookie onto a cutting board and cut into 16 wedges. Turn right side up and transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Whisk powdered sugar, milk, remaining ¼ tsp. salt, and remaining 1 tsp. vanilla in a small wide bowl until smooth. The glaze should be the consistency of heavy cream; thin with more milk if needed. Transfer half of the glaze to another small wide bowl (you’ll need to use 2 bowls as the glaze will start to collect crumbs and you’ll want a fresh start). Working one at a time, lightly dip half of the wedges, top side down, into first bowl of glaze so that only the surface is covered and no glaze drips down the sides. Use a toothpick to pop any bubbles and smooth glaze; coating should be thin enough to see the cookie peeking through. Repeat with remaining wedges and second bowl of glaze. Top wedges with remaining candied pecans and let sit 10 minutes. Sprinkle with sanding sugar and glitter and let sit until glaze is set, about 1 hour. Do Ahead: Cookies can be baked 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

129	adjudicated	pos	Place sugar in a deep, heavy saucepan set over medium heat. Stir continuously and break up any lumps of sugar—this will help the sugar caramelize evenly. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring with a spatula to dissolve the sugar, then simmer, without stirring, until the caramel turns the color of a copper penny (or an Irish setter), about 4 minutes. If, while the caramel cooks, any sugar crystallizes on the sides of the pan, brush down the sides with a clean, wet pastry brush. Reduce the heat to low, and slowly add 1/2 cup of the cream (the caramel will rise and bubble and might spit, so be careful). Stir until the cream is well incorporated into the caramel. Remove from the heat and stir in salt. Should the caramel seize and harden, return the mixture to the heat and stir until it softens. Remove from heat and set aside. Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl and set another bowl over it. Set aside.Pour the milk and remaining 1 1/2 cups cream into a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (the bottom of the bowl should not touch the water). Add the vanilla bean seeds and pod and warm the mixture until you see steam rising from the top.Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, with a kitchen towel underneath it to prevent slipping, whisk together the egg yolks until uniform. While whisking, add a splash of the hot dairy mixture to the yolks. Continue to add the dairy mixture, whisking it in bit by bit, until you’ve added about half. Add the yolk mixture to the remaining dairy mixture in the double boiler, and stir in the caramel. Set the heat under the double boiler to medium and cook the custard, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon and reducing the heat to medium-low as necessary, until steam begins to rise from the surface and the custard thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally and run your finger through the custard. If the trail left by your finger stays separated, the custard is ready to be cooled.Strain the custard into the bowl sitting over the prepared ice bath and stir for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the custard has cooled. Transfer the custard to a quart-sized container, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or, preferably, overnight.Pour the chilled custard into an ice cream maker, add the salted caramel, and freeze according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Place the container in which you refrigerated the custard in the freezer so you can use it to store the finished ice cream. Churn the ice cream until the texture resembles “soft serve.” Transfer the ice cream to the chilled storage container and freeze until hardened to your desired consistency. Alternatively, you can serve it immediately—it will be the consistency of gelato. The ice cream will keep, frozen, for up to 7 days.

145	adjudicated	pos	To make the old dough, using your hands or a rubber spatula, squish together the flour, water, and yeast in a bowl until it forms a thick paste. Scrape the paste into a small, lightly oiled container, cover, and let it sit out for 1½ to 2 hours, or refrigerate overnight and bring to room temperature for at least 2 hours before using. When ready, the ball will have doubled in volume. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the old dough, water, oil, and salt. Squish the old dough with your hands to break it up in the water; it doesn’t have to be perfectly mixed in. Fit the stand mixer with the paddle attachment and add a third of the flour. Mix on low speed until the dough looks like pancake batter. Add the remaining flour and mix on low speed until incorporated. Remove the paddle attachment, pulling off any dough stuck to it. If there is flour at the base of the bowl, use your hands to press the dough into the flour. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough sit for 20 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate. Remove the towel and attach the dough hook to the stand mixer. Mix the dough on medium speed until the dough releases from the sides of the bowl without sticking and feels smooth to the touch, about 4 minutes. Turn the mixer off and reposition the dough to the center of the bowl if it seems to get stuck on one side of the bowl. Combine the old dough, water, oil, and salt in a large bowl and mix together, squishing the old dough into the water with your hands. Stir in the flour gradually with your fingers until a crumbly dough forms, then knead it a few times in the bowl by folding the dough over itself and pressing it down into the bowl. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 20 minutes. Dust the counter lightly with flour and place the dough on top. Begin kneading by stretching and folding the dough over itself until it is smooth to the touch, 5 to 7 minutes. Lightly oil an 8 cup [2 L] glass Pyrex or a large glass bowl and place the dough inside. Cover the bowl with a lid, a plate, or plastic wrap, and let it rest for 3 hours or until doubled in volume. Or refrigerate overnight and let the dough come to room temperature for at least 2 hours before portioning. To portion and shape the dough, dust the counter lightly with flour and place the dough on top. Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into eight pieces about 3.5 oz [100 g] each. To shape the dough, cup the palm of your hand over one portion at a time and move your hand in a circle. The friction from the counter will help form the dough into a ball. If there is too much flour on the surface and the dough is sliding around, give the counter a spritz of water and try again. Lightly oil a rimmed tray and place the dough on the tray, ensuring that the portions are not touching. Cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap lightly coated with oil. Leave out for 1 to 1½ hours, or until puffy, or refrigerate for up to 3 days. If you refrigerate the dough, use plastic wrap to cover it and expect it to take an hour or two to return to room temperature before it is ready to be rolled out. Dust the counter lightly with flour. Pat a portion of dough into an oval with your fingertips. Using a rolling pin and moving back and forth, roll the dough as thinly as possible into an oval about 13 by 9 in [33 by 23 cm]. If the dough resists stretching, let it relax and start working on another portion before returning to it. You can also gently stretch the dough with your hands to correct the shape. It doesn’t have to look perfect. Place a carbon-steel wok upside down over a burner. Have a pair of tongs handy. Heat the wok over high heat for 1 minute or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates. Drape the dough over the wok. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift it easily from the wok with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for another 30 seconds. Transfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, turn off the burner. The wok heats up quickly, and it will

Meanwhile, heat a 10" ovenproof skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Add 2 Tbsp. butter and swirl to coat; arrange apple halves cut sides down in a single layer in skillet. Cook apples, undisturbed, rotating skillet on burner as needed for even browning, until cut sides are golden brown, 5–10 minutes (the timing depends on the juiciness of the apples; juicier apples will take longer). Turn apples over and cook on rounded sides just until they start to release their juices and the tip of a knife slides through with slight resistance, about 5 minutes. Transfer apples to a plate, arrange cut sides up, and let cool. Add ¼ cup brown sugar and 1 Tbsp. water to skillet and set over medium heat. Stir with a wooden spoon or heatproof rubber spatula until sugar is dissolved, then cook, swirling skillet occasionally (do not stir at this point), until thick and bubbling in a thin layer, about 1 minute.

Peel away sides of containers from ice cream. Cut ice cream into 2" pieces and place in a medium bowl. Let sit until slightly softened, about 5 minutes, then stir with a wooden spoon or large rubber spatula until the consistency of thick cake batter. Scrape almond-butter mixture into bowl with ice cream and fold several times with a rubber spatula to create a marbled effect (do not overmix; you want defined ribbons running through). Scrape into prepared baking pan and spread out into an even layer. Smooth top, then bring plastic up and over ice cream. Freeze until hard, about 12 hours. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and place in freezer. (Freeze at least 15 minutes before using to ensure they are properly chilled.) Remove baking pan with ice cream from freezer. Use edges of plastic to unmold ice cream and place on a cutting board; peel off plastic. Use a dry hot knife (run under hot water and wipe dry between slices) to cut ice cream into a 6x4 grid to make 24 bars (if ice cream starts to soften, freeze again until firm before proceeding). Place bars on chilled baking sheet, spacing evenly; freeze until firm, 40–45 minutes. Whisk coconut oil, a pinch of kosher salt, remaining 1 cup almond butter, and remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar in a small bowl until smooth. Working one at a time and using a fork, dip ice cream bars into coconut-oil mixture, allowing excess to drip back into bowl, then place on remaining chilled baking sheet and immediately sprinkle with pretzels and sea salt. Return ice cream to freezer from time to time while you work if it becomes too soft. Freeze bars until ice cream and nut-butter shells are hard, at least 1 hour, before serving. Bars can be made 1 week ahead. Once frozen solid, wrap in plastic; keep frozen.

Meanwhile, make the dressing: Combine the miso paste, ginger, soy sauce, and lime juice in a blender and blend, at medium speed until smooth. Add the egg and blend until combined. With the motor running, slowly add the oil. Once the dressing is smooth, add pepper to taste; you won't need salt, because the miso and soy sauce are salty. (The dressing can be made up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated, covered.) Add the soba noodles to the boiling water and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Drain the noodles and rinse well under cold running water. Drain well, transfer to a baking sheet, then spread out and let cool. In a large bowl, combine the noodles with the carrots, scallions, and radishes. Toss with the miso dressing and serve at room temperature or cold. (The soba salad can be made up to 2 hours in advance.)
188	adjudicated	pos	1. To make the puddings, heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter six 10-ounce ramekins. Combine the brioche and milk in a saucepan and let sit for 10 minutes. 2. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat, and when bubbles form around the edges of the milk, remove from the heat. 3. In a mixer fitted with a paddle (or in a bowl with a hand mixer), beat together the egg yolks and sugar until light and pale. Lightly beat the hot bread mixture into the eggs. It will break up into chunks, but don't let it turn to mash. 4. Whisk the whites with the salt in the clean mixer bowl (or a large bowl) until they hold soft peaks. Beat in the vanilla. Fold the whites into the bread mixture. Ladle the pudding mixture into the ramekins. Set the ramekins in a baking dish just large enough to hold them, and pour enough boiling water into the dish to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. 5. Bake the puddings until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from the water bath. 6. While the puddings bake, make the sauce: Combine the sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and water in a small saucepan, bring to a boil, and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the white wine. Taste and adjust the orange juice and sugar, if desired. 7. To serve, invert the puddings into shallow bowls, and spoon a little sauce over and around each. JANUARY 7, 1877: "THE HOUSEHOLD: RECEIPTS FOR THE TABLE." RECIPE SIGNED GOOD HOUSEKEEPER. —1877

Do ahead: Blondies can be made 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
192	adjudicated	pos	Put oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 475°F. While oven is preheating, toast nuts on a baking sheet in oven until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Pat chicken dry, then put in a large shallow heavy baking pan (1 inch deep) without crowding and rub with salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons oil. Bake, without turning, until golden brown and cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes. While chicken bakes, blend together bell peppers, bread crumbs, walnuts, garlic paste, pomegranate molasses, cumin, and cayenne in a food processor until as smooth as possible, about 1 minute. With motor running, gradually add remaining 6 tablespoons oil and blend until combined well. Season sauce with salt and drizzle over baked chicken.
193	adjudicated	pos	Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add squash and sauté until beginning to soften and brown around edges, about 5 minutes. Transfer squash to medium bowl. Reduce heat to medium; add remaining 1 tablespoon oil, leeks, and thyme to same pot and stir until tender but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add rice and stir 1 minute. Add 1 cup broth and simmer until absorbed, stirring frequently, 3 to 4 minutes. Add remaining broth by 1/2 cupfuls, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding next, stirring often, about 15 minutes. Return squash to pot. Continue to cook until rice is just tender but still very creamy, stirring gently and often, about 10 minutes longer (about 25 minutes total cooking time). Remove from heat. Stir in basil and 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to large bowl and serve with additional Parmesan cheese.
194	adjudicated	pos	Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350°F. Lightly brush a 10"-diameter cake pan with oil. Line the bottom with a round of parchment; brush parchment with oil. Dust sides of pan with cocoa powder; tap out excess. Toast almonds on a rimmed baking sheet until fragrant and slightly darkened, 8–10 minutes. Let cool. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F. Meanwhile, heat chocolate and 1 cup oil in a medium heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (don’t let bowl touch the water), stirring often, until mixture is smooth. Remove from heat. Pulse almonds, salt, and 1/4 cup cocoa in food processor until nuts are finely ground. Add shredded coconut and pulse a couple of times to combine. Beat eggs on medium speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until no longer streaky, about 20 seconds. Add both sugars and vanilla, increase speed to high, and beat until mixture is pale, thick, and starts to hold the marks of the whisk, about 2 minutes (it should fall off the whisk and immediately sink back into itself). Switch to the paddle attachment and with mixer on low speed, gradually add chocolate mixture. Beat to incorporate, then mix in almond mixture. Fold batter several times with a rubber spatula, making sure to scrape the bottom and sides. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth top. Bake cake until firm to the touch and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean but greasy, 35–45 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool 15–20 minutes in pan (cake might fall slightly in the center; that’s okay). Run a paring knife or small offset spatula around edges of cake; invert onto rack. Carefully peel away parchment; let cool completely. Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine chocolate, 1 Tbsp. agave nectar, and salt in a medium bowl. Bring coconut milk to a simmer in a small saucepan over low; pour over chocolate mixture. Let sit until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, toss coconut flakes, almonds, sugar, and remaining 1 tsp. agave nectar on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and toast until golden, about 4 minutes. Let almond-coconut mixture cool, then break into smaller clusters. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat chocolate mixture until it has lost its sheen and is thick enough to hold very soft peaks, 6–8 minutes (ganache won’t be quite as thick as frosting but close). Working quickly before ganache starts to set, scrape on top of cake and spread to edges with a small offset spatula or knife. Top with almond-coconut clusters. Cake can be baked and cooled 1 day ahead. Store tightly covered at room temperature until ready to serve.
195	adjudicated	pos	1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. 2. Spread the bread on a large baking sheet (or 2 smaller baking sheets) in an even layer and bake, stirring a few times, until light golden brown, about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Put the cubes into a very large bowl. 3. Raise the oven temperature to 375°F. 4. Combine the mushrooms in a large baking dish or rimmed baking sheet, toss with 3 tablespoons of the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven, stirring several times, until soft and golden brown, about 30 minutes. 5. While the mushrooms are roasting, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large deep sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and the fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Transfer the bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. 6. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat in the sauté pan and return to the stove over high heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add 3 cups of the chicken stock, the sage, thyme, and parsley and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer. 7. Add the mushrooms to the bread. Whisk the eggs in a small bowl and then whisk in a few tablespoons of the warm stock mixture. Add the eggs and the rest of the stock mixture to the bread, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. The dressing should be very wet; add more stock as needed. Scrape the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
196	adjudicated	pos	Whisk garlic, pickle brine, mustard, and salt in a large bowl to combine. Add tomatoes and pickled peppers and gently toss to combine. Let sit, tossing occasionally, while you cook the bacon, bread, and peaches. Arrange bacon in a cold large cast-iron skillet and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mostly crisp (there can still be a few soft, chewy spots if you’re into that sort of thing), about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour bacon fat into a small bowl; set aside. Wipe out skillet. Heat 2 Tbsp. reserved bacon fat in same skillet. Working in batches and adding more bacon fat as needed, toast bread until golden (a few char marks are fine), about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Wipe out skillet. Heat another 1 Tbsp. bacon fat (if you’ve run out, use vegetable or olive oil) in same skillet and cook peach halves, cut side down, until lightly charred, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; let sit until cool enough to handle. Slice each half in half again or into thirds and add to bowl with tomatoes. Tear toasted bread into 1"–1½" pieces and add to bowl. Add bacon and toss gently to combine and saturate bread with juices collected in bowl. Transfer panzanella to a platter or individual bowls to serve.
197	adjudicated	pos	Bring water to a vigorous boil in a large heavy pot, then add tapioca pearls and return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and gently boil, covered, stirring occasionally, until tapioca pearls are almost transparent, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove from heat and stir mixture, then let stand, covered, until liquid is thick and pearls are transparent, about 45 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse with cold water, then drain well and transfer to a large bowl. Cut a round of parchment paper slightly larger than the inside of a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot. Peel 2 (3- by 1-inch) strips zest from 1 satsuma with a vegetable peeler. Remove any white pith with a sharp knife. Bring water, sugar, honey, cinnamon, zests, and star anise to a boil in 4- to 5-quart pot over high heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat. Add tea bag and steep, dunking bag a few times, 3 minutes. Squeeze bag and discard. Meanwhile, peel pears, then quarter lengthwise and core. Return liquid to a boil over high heat, then add pears in 1 layer and cover surface directly with round of parchment, folding up side against side of pot to seal surface completely. Return to a boil, then cook pears at a bare simmer, turning occasionally, until just tender when pierced with a sharp knife, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let pears steep in liquid, still covered, turning occasionally, until cooled completely, about 1 1/2 hours. Carefully transfer pears with a slotted spoon to a shallow dish, then strain liquid through a paper-towel-lined sieve into measuring cup. Discard solids, reserving star anise and cinnamon sticks for garnish if desired. Pour 1 cup poaching liquid over tapioca, then pour remaining liquid over pears. Cut off peel, including all white pith, from satsumas with a sharp knife. Cut segments free from membranes, letting them fall into a bowl. Serve pears with tapioca pearls and poaching liquid spooned around them. Top with satsumas.
198	adjudicated	pos	Heat 1/4 cup oil in a medium Dutch oven or other heavy pot with a lid over medium-high. Add fennel and leek and season with salt. Cook, stirring often, until vegetables are starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and corn and cook, stirring, until garlic is translucent, about 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup water and simmer until corn is bright yellow and starting to soften, about 2 minutes. Add wine and simmer until slightly reduced, about 30 seconds. Add clams, cover pot, and reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until clams open, 8–12 minutes. Discard any clams that have not opened. Top with parsley, chives, and a few pinches of red pepper flakes and drizzle with oil. Serve with grilled bread for soaking up pan sauces.
199	adjudicated	pos	1. Trim each rack of ribs or have your butcher do this for you. 2. Place the ribs in a large nonreactive roasting pan. Pour the cider over the ribs. Squeeze the juice from the lemons over the ribs, catching the seeds with your fingers. Turn the ribs a couple of time to coat all over with marinade. If desired, let the ribs marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 4 to 6 hours, turning several times. 3. Drain the ribs and blot dry with paper towels. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the rub on both sides of the ribs, patting it onto the meat with your fingers. Let the ribs stand in the refrigerator, covered, for 1 to 2 hours. 4. Set up the grill for indirect grilling and preheat to medium. If using a charcoal grill, place a large drip pan in the center. If using a gas grill, place all the wood chips in the smoker box or in a smoker pouch and preheat to high until you see smoke, then reduce the heat to medium. 5. When ready to cook, if using charcoal, toss 1 cup of wood chips on the coals. Place the ribs in the center of the hot grate, away from the heat. Cover the grill and cook the ribs for 2 to 3 hours. After 30 minutes, spray the ribs with apple cider and continue to spray every half hour until ready to brush with the sauce. If using a charcoal grill, you'll need to add 12 fresh coals and 1/2 cup wood chips per side after each hour. 6. Lightly brush the ribs with 1 cup of the sauce 20 minutes before the ribs are done. When the ribs are fully cooked, the meat will have shrunk back from the bones about 1/4 inch, and the meat will be tender enough to tear apart with your fingers. But don't overcook; the ribs should have some chew to them. If the ribs start to dry out, wrap them in aluminum foil for the last hour of cooking. 7. Transfer the ribs to plates or a platter. Sprinkle the ribs with the remaining rub and lightly brush again with barbecue sauce. Let the ribs rest for a few minutes, then serve with the remaining barbecue sauce on the side. You can also cook the ribs in a smoker. Smoke them for 4 to 5 hours at 225°F This is a wonderful way to prepare baby back ribs. In this case, you'll need to allow 1 to 1 1/2 hours for indirect grilling or 2 to 3 hours for cooking in a smoker.

Squeeze lemon peel over glass, making sure oils fall into glass, then brush peel along outer lip of glass, drop peel in drink, and serve.
201	adjudicated	pos	Place noodles in large bowl. Add enough boiling water to cover noodles. Let stand until noodles are soft, about 5 minutes; drain. Combine stock, shallots, ginger, and fish sauce in large pot. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover partially, and simmer 10 minutes. Discard ginger slices. Return stock to boil. Stir in noodles and turkey; simmer until turkey is heated through, about 3 minutes. Ladle soup into bowls. Serve, allowing diners to top each serving with bean sprouts, mint leaves, chiles, and lime wedges to squeeze over. Break up the carcass so that it its into a 6-quart or larger pot. Add 3 quarts water and 1 each coarsely chopped onion, carrot, and celery stalk. Bring to boil, skimming off any foam. Add 6 parsley sprigs, 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, and 1/4 teaspoon whole peppercorns. Simmer 2 to 3 hours. Strain, then skim off any fat from surface of the broth.
202	adjudicated	pos	1. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and flaxseeds, if using, in a mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the yogurt and milk. Stir with a whisk until the batter is just smooth; it should have an easy-to-pour consistency, but not too thin. Add more milk as needed. Don't overbeat. 2. Heat a nonstick griddle or a large nonstick skillet that has been lightly coated with some of the margarine. Ladle on the batter to form 3- to 4-inch pancakes. Cook on both sides over medium heat until golden brown. Serve hot with maple syrup. Multigrain: Substitute 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the flour with another type of flour such as spelt, kamut, buckwheat, cornmeal, or rye, or use a combination of two different types of flour equaling 1/2 to 3/4 cup. Fruity pancakes: Add a cup or so of thinly sliced fruits—one kind or a combination—to the batter. Try pears, peaches, nectarines, strawberries, wild blueberries, or other berries. Cinnamon-apple pancakes: Add 1 heaping cup very thinly sliced, peeled apple (any soft cooking variety such as Cortland, McIntosh, or Golden Delicious) and ground cinnamon to taste to the batter. Banana-nut: Add 1 medium thinly sliced banana, 1/4 to 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts or pecans, and a pinch of ground nutmeg to the batter.
203	adjudicated	pos	Cook 2 ounces capellini pasta and 2 cups Parmesan Broth in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring, until pasta is al dente and broth is reduced and thickened, about 3 minutes (if too thick, thin with more broth). Divide pasta between bowls; twist into tight nests. Add broth and top each with 1 large egg yolk, grated Parmesan, thyme leaves, and pepper.
204	adjudicated	pos	Preheat oven to 425°F. Place carrots on a rimmed baking sheet and onions and fennel on another rimmed baking sheet. (Make sure to give them plenty of room, which is key to roasted veggies with nicely browned edges.) Drizzle vegetables with 2 Tbsp. oil, dividing evenly; season with salt and pepper. Roast, tossing occasionally, until golden brown and tender, 20–25 minutes for carrots and 35–45 minutes for onions and fennel. Let cool. Meanwhile, cook sunflower seeds, coriander seeds, Aleppo pepper, paprika, and remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until oil is gently bubbling around seeds and spices are fragrant (be careful not to burn), about 2 minutes. Let cool. Stir in vinegar and lemon juice; season vinaigrette with salt and pepper. Combine roasted carrots, fennel, and onions onto the same baking sheet, drizzle vinaigrette over, and toss to coat well; transfer to a platter. Just before serving, re-toss vegetables to pull up any dressing that may have settled at the bottom of the platter and scatter mint over top. Dish (without mint) can be made 3 hours ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
205	adjudicated	pos	Position rack in upper third of oven and preheat to 425°F. Mix brown sugar, cumin, salt, pepper, and cayenne in a small bowl. Toss squash, fennel, and grapes with oil and half of spice mixture on rimmed baking sheet and arrange in a single layer. Rub chicken thighs with remaining spice mixture and arrange, skin side up, on top of fruit and vegetables. Roast until skin is browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of chicken registers 165°F, about 35 minutes; if chicken skin or vegetables start to burn, move pan to a lower rack to finish cooking. Divide chicken, fruit, and vegetables among 4 plates and top with mint.
206	adjudicated	pos	Coarsely chop garlic and parsley leaves in processor. Add garbanzo beans to processor and blend 30 seconds. Add sour cream, tahini, Asian sesame oil, lemon peel, cumin, salt, and cayenne pepper; blend until smooth. Serve the hummus with a mix of purple, white, and green cauliflower; steam the florets in 3 separate batches until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.
207	adjudicated	pos	Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Let cool slightly. Crumble graham crackers into a food processor. Add melted butter, sugar, and 1/4 tsp. salt and process until mixture resembles wet sand. Transfer mixture to a shallow 9"-diameter pie dish. Using the bottom of a measuring cup, press crust firmly and evenly across bottom and up sides of dish. Freeze 20 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk cream in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. Finely grate zest from 1 lime half into a small bowl; set aside. Squeeze juice from all of the limes into a fine-mesh sieve set over a glass measuring cup (you should have about 1/2 cup juice). Pour lime juice into another medium bowl. Add condensed milk, tequila, and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt and whisk until mixture is smooth. Gently fold in half of the whipped cream just to combine, then add the remaining whipped cream and gently fold until no streaks remain (be careful not to overmix; you want to keep as much air in the whipped cream as possible). Remove pie dish from the freezer and scrape filling into crust. Use a spoon to gently spread filling evenly all the way to the edges. Sprinkle with reserved lime zest and freeze until filling is set, at least 8 hours. Do Ahead: Pie can be made 3 days ahead. Cover; keep chilled. Let soften in fridge 30 minutes before slicing.
208	adjudicated	pos	Preheat broiler. Put fish, skin side down, on foil-lined rack of a broiler pan. Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper (total), then brush with 1 tablespoon nut oil. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat until just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, grate zest from orange with a Microplane and squeeze 1/4 cup juice. Whisk together zest, orange juice, lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper, then add remaining 2 tablespoons nut oil in a slow stream, whisking. Stir in scallion. Transfer fillets (without skin; it will be stuck to foil) with a metal spatula to plates, then drizzle with some of vinaigrette and sprinkle with nuts. Serve remaining vinaigrette on the side.
209	adjudicated	neg	Place the onion, garlic, tomato, black peppercorns, green chilli, chilli powder and curry leaves in a food processor and blitz until you have a fine paste.

A few crushed curry leaves can be used as a garnish. Pictured left.
210	adjudicated	pos	Whisk all ingredients except butter in a medium bowl until no lumps of sugar remain. Rub butter into oat mixture with your fingertips until it's completely incorporated. If butter begins to soften while mixing, chill mixture to firm it up, about 15 minutes (cold butter ensures a flaky, tender crumble). Cover and chill crumble up to 5 days ahead. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil; lightly coat with nonstick spray (for easy cleanup in case the pie bubbles over) and set aside. Line pie dish with crust and crimp edges decoratively. Place pie dish on prepared baking sheet. Combine cherries and remaining 5 ingredients in a large bowl. Using a rubber spatula, gently mix until cherries are coated and mixture is evenly distributed. Pour cherries into pie crust and top evenly with crumble. Bake until pie crust and center of crumble are deep golden brown and juices from cherries are bubbling and look thickened, 1 1/4-1 1/2 hours. (The juices will begin to ooze out of crust and onto foillined sheet.) Let pie cool for at least 2 hours at room temperature to allow filling to set properly. (Cutting into the pie before it's set will result in a runny filling.) Cover and let stand up to 1 day at room temperature.
211	adjudicated	pos	Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add apples and 1 tablespoon maple syrup; sauté until apples are tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in remaining 1/2 cup maple syrup and cinnamon. Combine first 6 ingredients in large bowl; whisk to blend. Whisk buttermilk, yogurt, and egg in medium bowl to blend; add to dry ingredients and stir until just blended but still lumpy. Gently mix in 1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter. Heat griddle or large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Spread thin coating of butter over griddle and let melt. Working in batches, drop batter by 1/3 cupfuls onto griddle, spacing apart. Cook pancakes until brown on bottom and bubbles form on top, about 3 minutes. Turn pancakes over and cook until bottoms are brown and pancakes are barely firm to touch. Transfer to plates. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more butter to griddle as needed. Spoon apples over pancakes. Serve, passing additional maple syrup.
212	adjudicated	pos	Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Butter 2 (8- by 2-inch) round cake pans and dust with flour, knocking out excess. Whisk together flour (1 1/2 cups), baking powder, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice in a medium bowl. Combine apple cider and lemon juice in a small measuring cup. Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, then add brown sugar and beat until combined. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition (mixture will look curdled). Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture and cider mixture alternately in 3 batches, beginning and ending with flour mixture and mixing until just combined. Divide batter between cake pans (batter will form a thin layer) and rap pans on work surface once to release any large air bubbles. Bake cake layers until they begin to pull away from sides of pans and a wooden pick or skewer inserted in center of each cake layer comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cake layers in pans on racks 5 minutes, then run a thin knife around edge of each layer and invert layers onto racks. Cool completely, at least 1 hour. Whisk together sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a 2-quart heavy saucepan. Whisk in cider, then bring to a boil over moderate heat, whisking constantly, and boil, whisking constantly, 1 minute (mixture will be very thick). Transfer to a metal bowl and set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water, then stir occasionally until cool, about 30 minutes. Beat butter in a large bowl with cleaned beaters at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, then add one third of cider mixture and beat until incorporated. Add remaining cider mixture and continue beating until smooth. When cakes are cool, arrange 1 layer flat side up on a flat serving plate or cake stand and spread top with 3/4 cup buttercream. Top with remaining cake layer flat side up. Frost top and side of cake with remaining buttercream. Chill 2 hours before serving (to firm up buttercream).
213	adjudicated	pos	Preheat oven to 250°. Whisk first 6 ingredients and 3/4 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Whisk coconut milk, 1 1/4 cups warm water, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, and vanilla in medium bowl. Whisk coconut milk mixture into dry ingredients until batter is pourable. Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat; brush with vegetable oil. Working in batches, add batter by 1/4 cupfuls. Working quickly and using back of spoon, spread each pancake to about 4-inch round. Cook until small bubbles appear on surface and bottoms of pancakes are golden, reducing heat if browning too quickly, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn over; cook until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to baking sheet. Keep warm in oven. Place 2 to 3 pancakes on each plate. Top with tropical fruit salad, maple syrup, and chopped pistachios.
214	adjudicated	pos	1. Preheat your oven to 400°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper and set them aside. 2. Combine the flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Transfer a few tablespoons of this dry ingredient mixture to a small bowl and add the frozen berries. Toss to coat the berries and set aside the small bowl. 3. To the large bowl with the dry ingredients, add the diced butter. Cut it in until the butter resembles pea-size chunks covered in flour. You can either use a pastry cutter or two knives and pretend like you're cutting steak with them over and over. 4. Add the milk to the dry ingredient/butter mixture and stir to combine.

236	adjudicated	pos	Whisk yeast, honey, and 2½ cups lukewarm water in a medium bowl and let sit 5 minutes. Add flour and salt; mix with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough forms and no dry streaks remain. Pour 4 Tbsp. oil into the biggest bowl that will fit in your refrigerator. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover with a silicone lid or plastic wrap and chill until dough is doubled in size (it should look very bubbly and alive), at least 8 hours and up to 1 day. Generously butter a 13x9" baking pan (for thicker focaccia that’s perfect for sandwiches) or an 18x13" rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1 Tbsp. oil into center of pan. Keeping the dough in the bowl, gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate dough while you form it into a rough ball. (Using a fork in each hand makes this process even easier and less messy!) Transfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over the dough and coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot until doubled in size, at least 1½ hours and up to 4 hours. To see if it’s ready, poke the dough with your finger. The dough should spring back slowly, leaving a small visible indentation. If it springs back quickly, the dough isn’t ready. (If at this point the dough is ready to bake but you aren’t, you can chill it up to 1 hour.) Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°F. Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed baking sheet, gently stretch out dough to fill (you may not need to do this if using a baking pan). Dimple focaccia all over with your fingers, as if you’re aggressively playing the piano, creating very deep depressions in the dough. Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake focaccia until puffed and golden brown all over, 20–30 minutes. Melt 4 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and grate in garlic (use 2 cloves if you’re garlic-shy or up to 4 if you love it). Return to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until garlic is just lightly toasted, about 45 seconds. Brush garlic butter all over focaccia. If you don’t want to serve the focaccia immediately, hold off on brushing so it remains crisp.

248	adjudicated	pos	Pulse cheese, flour, salt, and cayenne in a food processor to combine (4–6 pulses should do it). Add pimiento peppers and pulse until mixture turns orange (another 2 or 3 pulses). Add butter and pulse until largest pieces are about the size of a pea (4–6 pulses). Drizzle in 2 Tbsp. ice water and pulse 2 or 3 more times. Dough should stick together when squeezed in your hand. If not, pulse in another tablespoonful of ice water. Transfer dough to a work surface and form into a tightly packed 2"-diameter log. Gently sprinkle sesame seeds over surface and roll log over sesame seeds, pressing them into dough to adhere, until completely coated. Discard any sesame seeds that don’t stick. Wrap dough in plastic and chill at least 4 hours and up to 2 days before rolling out. Place a rack in the middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Unwrap dough and using a sharp knife, slice into thin rounds; aim for 1/8"–1/4" thick. Transfer rounds to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing about 1" apart (they won’t all fit in one batch). Prick each cracker 3–4 times with a fork to keep them from puffing up and bake, rotating baking sheet front to back halfway through, until tops and edges are golden, 25–30 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet; crackers will crisp as they cool. Repeat with remaining rounds and a fresh parchment-lined baking sheet.

250	adjudicated	neg	To make the dressing, put the ginger and citrus juices into a bowl, add the salt and stir until dissolved. Add the ground coriander and pepper, then while whisking, slowly pour in the olive oil until combined. Mix all the salad ingredients together in a large bowl, pour over the dressing and serve.
251	adjudicated	neg	Because agar-agar is seaweed-based and fairly delicate to work with, this recipe might be one you can’t multitask until you get a good feel for it. Handle with care, and let’s hope you don’t have to frustratingly do it over and over again. Heat water and salted plum powder in pot over medium heat. When it starts to steam (not boil!), add lime juice and agar-agar. Whisk until agar-agar dissolves. Continue to whisk for 1 minute, or until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and pour in a container, then let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate to settle. Once it settles, add to a blender and puree until it forms a thicker saucy consistency. Store in fridge until you’re ready to bust that bad boy out! If using gelatin sheets, add to a bowl of ice-cold water and submerge. Soak (aka let the gelatin bloom) for 5–7 minutes, or until the sheets soften. To prevent sheets from breaking down, drain water immediately after the 5–7 minutes and gently wring out remaining water from the sheets, just like you were wringing out a towel. If using powdered gelatin, place gelatin in a bowl and add 1/3 cup heavy cream. Let it sit. Let it bloom. If using a fun mold to shape and pop out your panna cotta, brush a light layer of cooking oil on the bottom and sides. Next, drain syrup from can of lychee (or save for a lychee-flavored cocktail or anything else that could use an “infused” sugary syrup, yuuuuummers!). Add lychees to a blender and puree until smooth. Set aside. This next step is very delicate because gelatin in any form is fairly unstable, so this may take some trial and error, based on a balance of your heat and your feel for that heat. You’ll know what I mean if you mess up. If you don’t, you’re a natural-born talent! Heat a pot with milk, sugar, and remaining heavy cream on medium-low heat until sugar dissolves and liquid is warm enough to touch. Like the Salted Plum Sauce, the milk, sugar, and heavy cream should steam but not boil. If you have a thermometer, DO NOT go over 145°F. Next, add gelatin (sheets or powdered in heavy cream), then whisk until gelatin dissolves. This will take a few minutes. Remove from heat, then immediately add lychee puree while the cream is still warm. Mix gently with a spatula. Ladle into ramekins, small bowls, your preferred fancy or not-so-fancy container, or into your pre-oil-brushed mold. Refrigerate, carefully. Gelatin is fairly docile and irritably unstable. As it cools, however, panna cotta should solidify within an hour. If after 2 hours it still hasn’t settled, don’t fret—you can still recover. Recombine the cream in a pot and warm to right below boiling. Add a tad bit more (bloomed) gelatin, then remove from heat. Repour into molds. Be careful not to add too much gelatin, which will result in a stiff, less creamy panna cotta, more of a superstiff Jell-O than panna cotta. Garnish with a thin layer of Salted Plum Sauce on top of your final plating—do fancy dots or a paintbrush swipe if you would like—and edible flowers (if you somehow got these) and pomegranate seeds (if in season and available). Bon appetit, y’all.
252	adjudicated	neg	Combine buttermilk, cayenne, garlic powder, salt, and paprika in a large bowl or large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken thighs, cover bowl or seal bag, and toss to coat. Chill at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours. Bring 4 cups salted water to a boil and gradually add grits, whisking constantly. Cook, whisking occasionally, until grits are very tender and creamy, 25–30 minutes. Add cream cheese and Parmesan; whisk until melted and incorporated; season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve. Whisk flour, cayenne, garlic powder, paprika, and 2 tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Remove chicken thighs from brine, letting excess drip off. Working in batches, dredge chicken in flour mixture, occasionally dipping your fingers in brine as you pack on flour to help create moistened, shaggy bits (the makings of a super-crisp crust); transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Fit a large cast-iron skillet with thermometer and heat oil until thermometer registers 350°F. Working in batches and returning oil to 350°F between batches, fry chicken thighs, turning occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and coating is deep golden brown and crisp, 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a baking sheet and let sit while you cook the kale. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high. Add kale in large handfuls, letting it cook down slightly before adding more and tossing to coat. Season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing occasionally, until wilted and bright green, about 2 minutes. Add vinegar and 1 Tbsp. pepper jelly and toss to coat. Divide grits evenly among bowls and top with kale, fried chicken, and more pepper jelly.
253	adjudicated	pos	Cut the cabbage into the thinnest strips you can and make sure those pieces are no longer than 2 inches. This is a great time to get good with your knife if you are looking for a silver f**king lining in all that chopping. Chop the carrot into thin matchsticks of the same length.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line cookie sheets with aluminum foil. 5. Divide the dough into thirds. Divide each third into 10 equal pieces. Using your palms, roll each piece on a lightly floured work surface into a rope 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter. Gently trace the design of your choice onto the prepared cookie sheets (a wooden spoon handle or chopstick works well for tracing on foil). Outline each design with a rope of dough, pressing the ends together to seal securely. 6. Sprinkle the inside of each design with the crushed candies, dividing the candies evenly among the outlined designs and creating an even layer. 7. Bake in the center of the oven or until the edges of the cookies are golden and the candy has melted, 6 to 9 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the cookie sheets on wire racks until the candy hardens, about 5 minutes. Gently peel the foil away from the cookies and transfer to the racks to cool completely.

With a wide spatula, scoop the rice from the pot, making sure not to disturb the crust (tadig) that formed on the bottom of the pot. Serve the rice on a flat serving platter, mounding it into the shape of a pyramid. Turn the tadig out onto a flat serving platter by inverting the pot, as you would invert a cake pan, or cut it into pieces and serve around the rice. 1. To make saffron water, mix together 1 teaspoon crushed saffron threads and 1/4 cup hot water. Steep for a few minutes, until the water becomes yellow. 2. Mix saffron water with steamed white rice. Use this intensely yellow rice to make designs on the Chelo. Pour 1/2 cup water mixed with 1/4 cup canola oil onto the pyramid in a large pot. You can also freeze this rice, as long as you do not stir it until it is completely defrosted. You can even cook it, freeze it, and later steam it as it defrosts. I know I will have to spend time in "rice hell" for admitting to freezing Persian rice, but it is worth it to make my life easier!

Fold in half crosswise, then, using a rolling pin, gently flatten into an 8x4" rectangle. Cut dough in half lengthwise and in quarters crosswise to form 8 even squares. Transfer to prepared pan, spacing 2" apart. Sprinkle tops generously with demerara sugar and lightly with flaky sea salt. Bake until scones are golden brown, 25-30 minutes. Meanwhile, melt remaining 4 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. When butter bubbles, remove from heat and skim off foam from surface. As soon as the scones come out of the oven, lightly brush tops with clarified butter, leaving behind white solids in bottom of saucepan. Cool scones on sheet on a wire rack and serve hot, warm, or room temperature.
272	adjudicated	neg	Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat granulated sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Add egg and continue to beat, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until incorporated. Reduce speed to low and gradually add buttermilk and coffee concentrate, beating just until combined. Gradually add dry ingredients and beat just until dough comes together. Turn out dough onto a large piece of parchment paper and cover with a second sheet of parchment. Using a rolling pin, roll dough between parchment sheets to about 1/3" thick. Transfer dough in parchment to a rimmed baking sheet and freeze until firm, about 20 minutes. Peel off top sheet of parchment. Working on bottom sheet, punch out as many rounds as you can with 3" cutter, then use 1" cutter to punch out center of each round. Gather doughnut holes and scraps and re-roll; repeat process 3–4 times until all dough has been used (you should have 12 doughnuts). Place doughnuts on a second parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze until slightly chilled, about 5 minutes. Pour oil into a heavy-duty pot to a depth of 2" and fit pot with deep-fry thermometer. Heat oil to 375ºF. Working in batches, fry doughnuts until deep golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a wire rack lined with paper towels and let cool 2–3 minutes. Whisk powdered sugar and coffee concentrate in a large bowl until smooth. Dip warm doughnuts in glaze. Place on a wire rack to let glaze set, about 3 minutes, then dip again.
273	adjudicated	neg	Preheat oven to 450°F. Spray large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Toss potato wedges with canola oil in large bowl. Sprinkle potato wedges generously with salt and pepper; spread in single layer on prepared baking sheet. Roast potato wedges until tender and brown in spots, turning occasionally, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve.
274	adjudicated	pos	Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease the bottom and sides of a 10-inch cake pan well with some of the butter. Cut out a piece of parchment paper so it fits closely into the bottom of the cake pan. Line the bottom of the pan with the parchment, and then grease the parchment with more butter. Shake 1 tablespoon of the flour into the cake pan, and shake it around so it sticks to the butter. Tap out any excess flour that doesn't stick to the parchment or to the sides of the pan. Pour the root beer and molasses into a deep medium-sized pot, and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. (You need those high sides because the baking soda will froth up very high, and you don't want it to spill over! So make sure there's some meaningful space between the liquid and the top of the pot.) Pull the pot off the heat and whisk in all the baking soda, so it froths up. Then put the pot right in the fridge to cool down a little. While the root beer mix is cooling down, whisk the brown sugar, vegetable oil, granulated sugar, ginger, and vanilla extract together in a mixing bowl. The mixture will be a little chunky at this point. Crack the egg into the bowl and whisk well. The egg is what makes everything come together smoothly: you should have a thick paste. Set this aside. In another mixing bowl, combine rest of the flour with the baking powder, star anise, and cardamom. Grate in the nutmeg and lemon zest, and add the salt and pepper. Whisk everything together so it's well combined. Take the root beer mixture out of the fridge. Pour a third of the flour mixture into a large mixing bowl; pour in one-third of the root beer mixture, then one-third of the sugar paste. Whisk everything together slowly (so it doesn't splash everywhere), and then add another one-third of the flour, another one-third of the root beer, and so forth, until everything is combined in the bowl. (The mix doesn't need to be completely and smoothly combined until the last of the wet and dry mixtures are in the bowl.) You should have a very wet, almost liquid batter. Pour the batter into the cake pan, put the pan on a cookie sheet (to catch drips and splashes), and put it on the middle oven rack. Bake the cake for 45 minutes without opening the oven at all (this cake will sink if you shake it up while it's baking). Check it: the cake should be high and dark brown, with a little bit of spring-back when you touch it (but not too much—it's a very moist cake). If it's not quite ready, rotate the pan and put it back in the oven for another 5 minutes before checking it again. The whole baking process shouldn't take longer than 55 minutes, even in a slow oven. Whisk the cream and sassafras together in a small pot, and bring it up to a boil over medium-high heat. As soon as it boils, pull the mixture off the heat, pour it into a glass or ceramic container (something that won't crack from the heat), and put it in the fridge. Let the mixture cool for about 30 minutes while the sassafras steeps into the cream, so you have a nice root beer flavor. In a mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, star anise, cardamon, and salt. Grate in the nutmeg and lemon zest, and whisk everything together. Strain the cooled cream through a fine-mesh strainer into a small mixing bowl (so the sassafras pieces don't end up in the glaze). Gently whisk 1/2 cup of the cream into the powdered sugar mixture, holding back the last 2 tablespoons to see if you need it. If the mixture is dry and not coming together as a glaze, add more cream. Whisk the mixture well, until you have a shiny, thick liquid. When the cake is ready, pull it out of the oven and let it rest for about 5 minutes. Flip the cake out of the pan onto a serving plate. Spread the glaze thickly on top of the warm cake with a spoon. The glaze will melt and drip down the sides as you slather it on. You can serve the cake as soon as it's cooled to room temperature—but like all spice cakes, it's even better the day after you make it. Store it covered at room temperature.
275	adjudicated	neg	Pulse almonds with 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a food processor until ground to a fine paste. Bring milk, cinnamon, lemon rind, vanilla, and baking soda to a boil over medium-high heat in a large heavy-bottom saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk egg yolks, the remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar, and ground almonds until thick and pale. Remove cinnamon and lemon rind and discard. Whisking constantly, slowly add the milk to the yolk mixture. Return mixture to pan and cook over low heat, constantly stirring and scraping the bottom and sides of the pan, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside to cool completely, about 2 hours. Stir in rum or aguardiente. Serve.
276	adjudicated	pos	To make the salsa verde: Put the tomatillos, chile, onion, and garlic in a medium pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the vegetables are soft and the tomatillos turn pale green, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Carefully transfer the boiled vegetables, along with the cooking water, to a blender. Puree for a few seconds to blend; be sure to hold down the lid with a kitchen towel for safety. Add the 1/2 bay leaf, oregano, thyme, salt, and broth. Continue to puree until smooth. You should have about 1 quart of salsa verde. Place a wide pot or pan over medium-high heat and coat with the corn oil. When the oil is hazy, pour in the salsa verde; it will bubble a bit. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Cover, reduce the heat to very low, and keep warm while you finish the chips. Pour the vegetable oil into a heavy-bottomed pot or countertop deep fryer to a depth of about 2 inches and heat to 375°F over medium-high heat. Stack the tortillas and fan them with your thumb to separate. Cut the tortillas into 8 wedges like a pie. Working in batches, fry the tortilla chips, turning them with a skimmer or slotted spoon so they don't stick together, until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the chips to a paper towel-lined baking pan or brown paper bag to drain and cool. (Let the oil return to the proper temperature between batches.) To finish the chilaquiles, uncover the salsa verde and raise the heat to medium. Just when it starts to bubble, stir in the beaten eggs. Cook and stir for about 5 seconds, until the egg feathers into the sauce, thickening and binding it. Immediately add the chips, tossing gently until they have absorbed enough sauce to become soft. Take care not to break the chips. Sprinkle the Jack cheese on top and let it melt. Divide the chilaquiles among 4 plates. Sprinkle with the queso fresco, chopped onion, and cilantro. Garnish with the crema fresca and serve immediately.

Add wine, stirring to release any bits stuck on bottom of pot, and cook until reduced by two-thirds, about 2 minutes. Add ham hocks, thyme, beans, and 9 cups water. Season with several pinches of salt and lots of pepper and bring to a simmer. Cover with a lid, leaving slightly askew so steam can escape, and cook, adjusting heat to maintain a very gentle simmer and skimming foam from surface as needed, until beans are tender and creamy and broth is very flavorful, 2–2 1/2 hours. Remove pot from heat and transfer ham hocks to a cutting board. Let sit until cool enough to handle, then pull meat from bones and tear into bite-size pieces; discard fat, skin, and cartilage. Add meat and knuckle bones back to pot as you go. Let stew cool uncovered until no longer steaming. Cover pot and chill stew at least 12 hours (you can skip this step, but it will dramatically improve the flavor). Gently reheat stew, covered, until barely simmering. Pluck out and discard bones, thyme, and garlic heads (don't worry about any cloves that may have escaped into stew). Season with more salt and pepper if needed. Ladle into bowls and serve with Frizzled Shallots, Honey-Mustard Cream, cornichons, and/or dill as desired. Cream can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled. Stew can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.
292	adjudicated	pos	Butter muffin cups with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Stir together yeast, warm milk, and honey in a large bowl and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. (If mixture doesn't foam, start over with new yeast.) Mix flour, salt, pumpkin, 1 whole egg, yolk, orange zest and juice, and remaining 5 tablespoon butter into yeast mixture with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until a soft dough forms. Turn out dough onto a floured surface and knead, dusting surface and your hands with just enough flour to keep dough from sticking, until dough is elastic and smooth, 6 to 8 minutes. Form dough into a ball. Put dough in an oiled large bowl and turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel and let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Punch down dough (do not knead), then halve. Roll half of dough on a lightly floured surface with lightly floured hands into a 12-inch-long log (keep remaining half covered with plastic wrap). Cut log into 6 equal pieces, then cut each piece into thirds. Roll each piece into a 1-inch ball by cupping your hand and pushing dough against work surface as you roll in a circular motion. Put 3 balls side by side in each of 6 muffin cups. Make more rolls with remaining dough in same manner. Cover rolls with a kitchen towel (not terry cloth) and let rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until dough is about 1 inch above rim of muffin cups, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat oven to 375°F with rack in middle. Whisk together remaining egg and water and brush on tops of rolls. (You will have leftover egg wash.) Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer rolls to a rack and cool at least 20 minutes.
293	adjudicated	neg	For the Crème Fraîche: Stir together the crème fraîche and the herbs. Refrigerate and let sit for 30 minutes or overnight. For the Cake: Butter a 9-inch cast-iron skillet or 8-by-8-inch enameled cast-iron baking pan (if cooking in the grill) or standard 8-by-8-inch baking pan (if baking in your oven). (Don't put a standard baking pan inside your grill or over a fire.) Ignite the coals, turn a gas grill to high, or preheat an oven to 350°F. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugars on medium speed until the mixture looks creamy, about 3 minutes. Slowly add the egg, milk, and vanilla and mix just until combined. Gradually add the flour mixture, mixing just until smooth with a creamy texture. Pour the batter into the buttered pan. Arrange the strawberry halves, cut-side down, on top of the cake batter. Don't overlap the berries; use just enough strawberries for one layer and set aside the rest to use as garnish. TO BAKE IN A GRILL: When the grill reaches 350°F, slide in the cake, resting the pan on the grill rack, close the grill's lid and let it bake for at least 20 minutes with the grill lid closed. Test the cake: It's done when a skewer inserted into the center (but not in a strawberry) comes out clean and the cake is golden brown on top. TO BAKE IN AN OVEN: Bake for 10 minutes and then decrease the heat to 325°F and bake for an additional 45 to 50 minutes. The cake is done when a skewer inserted into the center (but not in a strawberry) comes out clean and the cake is golden brown on top. For the Glaze: While the cake is baking, in a small pan combine the balsamic vinegar, sugar, and black pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat and remove from the heat right away. Set it aside until the cake has baked. It should be the consistency of maple syrup; if it thickens too much before the cake comes out of the oven, stir in a few more spoonfuls of vinegar. As soon as the cake comes off the heat, drizzle the top with about three-fourths of the balsamic glaze. When the cake has cooled, cut it into wedges if baked in a skillet; if baked in a standard baking pan, cut it into squares. To garnish simply, top with a light dusting of confectioners' sugar. To dress up the cake, spoon several tablespoons of the Roasted Strawberries onto one side of each plate; on the other side of the plate drizzle a small pool of the balsamic glaze, and smear it lightly with the back of a spoon. Drizzle more balsamic glaze over the cake if you like. Set a cake slice on top the strawberry syrup, and top the cake with a spoonful of Herbed Crème Fraîche. Spoon any remaining crème fraîche into a bowl and set on a platter with leftover halved strawberries to pass so guests can add extra if they like.

Spoon filling into gratin dishes and sprinkle with topping, mounding it slightly in centers. Put in a shallow baking pan and bake 30 minutes, then rotate baking sheet and bake until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes more. Cool to warm or room temperature on a rack.
299	adjudicated	pos	If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderate. Stir together onion, parsley, tomato, oregano, Urfa and Maras peppers, 2 tablespoons oil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Pat lamb dry, then toss with black pepper, 1 tablespoon oil, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and thread 4 lamb cubes onto each skewer, leaving a little space in between cubes. Brush lavash (on both sides) with remaining 3 tablespoons oil and transfer to a platter. Grill lamb, covered only if using a gas grill, on lightly oiled grill rack, turning over once, until medium-rare, 6 to 8 minutes total. Transfer lamb skewers to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Grill lavash, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over once, until just heated through and lightly browned but still flexible, about 45 seconds total. Remove lamb from skewers and divide among pieces of lavash. Top lamb with tomato mixture and roll up lavash to enclose lamb. Serve immediately.
300	adjudicated	pos	Arrange racks in top and center of oven; preheat to 375°F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Working in batches, roll dough between 2 pieces of parchment until 1/8" thick. Chill while rolling remaining dough. Using a 4 1/2" round circle cutter, bowl, or large glass and keeping remaining dough chilled while you work, cut out circles of dough and transfer to prepared baking sheets. Chill 10 minutes. Reroll scraps one time and continue to cut and chill until you have 25 circles. Whisk egg and milk in a small bowl. Brush circles with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake circles, rotating sheets halfway through, until golden brown, 12–14 minutes. Transfer pie circles to a platter. Serve with toppings of your choice.
301	adjudicated	pos	Hold a large ice cube in the center of your palm. Use the back of a bar spoon (really, any spoon will work) to crack it into smaller jagged pieces. Transfer ice to a mixing glass and repeat until you've got enough cracked ice to fill glass. Add gin and vermouth (it doesn't matter what order). Just like in cooking, you should taste your ingredients separately and try to pair them thoughtfully (see chart at right for other Saunders pairings). Bond was wrong. Shaking breaks up the ice, which leads to overdiluted martinis. Some dilution is good; it softens the spirits so you can taste the botanicals, not just the heat of the alcohol. Rapidly stir 50 times— count to 50, for real!—in a circular motion; the outside of the glass will be very cold and frosty. Using a Hawthorne strainer, which fits snugly over the top of a mixing glass, or a slotted spoon (in a pinch), strain martini into a chilled Nick and Nora glass. Strain any remaining martini into a "sidecar" (use a minicarafe— on ice, of course), possibly the greatest drinking add-on ever invented.
302	adjudicated	pos	Soak noodles in a medium bowl of boiling-hot water 10 minutes. Meanwhile, blanch carrot in boiling water until softened, about 45 seconds. Drain. Rinse under cold water to stop cooking, then transfer to a small bowl along with cucumber, jalapeño, vinegar, sugar, 1 tablespoon lime juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Let stand 5 minutes. Reserve 2 tablespoons liquid and drain pickled vegetables. Drain noodles and rinse under cold water, then drain and pat dry. Toss noodles with remaining 3/4 teaspoon lime juice and snip with kitchen shears 5 or 6 times. Fill a shallow pan or pie plate with warm water. Soak 2 rice-paper rounds until they begin to soften, about 30 seconds, then let excess water drip off and stack soaked rounds on a work surface so that they overlap by all but 1 inch on either side. Put 2 pieces of romaine on bottom third of round. Top with one eighth of noodles (about 2 tablespoons), tofu (4 sticks), bean sprouts (about 2 tablespoons), herbs (3 tablespoons), and pickled vegetables (3 tablespoons). Roll up tightly around filling, folding in sides. Make 7 more rolls in same manner. Stir together hoisin sauce, peanut butter, water, and reserved 2 tablespoons pickling liquid. Serve rolls with dipping sauce.

335	adjudicated	pos	1. Heat the sugar and milk in a pan for about 5 minutes until the milk is warm—105-115°F—and the sugar has dissolved. Place the yeast into a bowl, pour in half the warm milk, then mix and set aside. Place the remaining milk back on the heat and add the butter. Heat gently for about 3 minutes (be careful not to let the milk boil). 2. Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the center. Add the egg yolks, yeasted milk, and the hot milk. Mix together, drawing in the surrounding flour to make a dough. 3. Tip the dough onto a floured work surface and knead with floured hands for a few minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Dust with a little extra flour if the mix is too sticky. Place in a clean bowl dusted with flour. Cover with plastic wrap to keep the dough from forming a skin on top and leave to rise in a warm place for 1-11/2 hours until doubled in size. 4. When the dough has risen, knock it back by giving it a thump and knead lightly on a floured work surface. Roll out the dough with a floured rolling pin to a thickness of about 3/4 inch and shape it into a 9 x 6-inch rectangle. Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into 12 rectangular pillows, then place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and leave to rise again for 30-40 minutes until doubled in size. (This will make the doughnuts light and fluffy once cooked.) 5. Meanwhile, make the filling. Put the cream in a pan and mix in the honey to taste. Put the chocolate and butter into a heatproof bowl. When the cream is almost boiling, pour it over the chocolate mixture and stir until well mixed, smooth, and glossy. 6. Combine the remaining sugar with the malt powder in a bowl and set aside. Put the oil in a deep-fat fryer and heat to 340°F, or fill a large saucepan one third full with vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat until a cube of bread dropped in it sizzles and turns golden brown in 30 seconds. Fry the doughnuts, in batches, for 3-4 minutes until evenly golden brown and cooked through, turning them in the oil once or twice. (You will need to moderate the heat between batches according to whether the doughnuts brown too quickly or too slowly.) Using a slotted spoon, remove the doughnuts from the hot oil and roll in the malt sugar to coat. 7. To fill the doughnuts, spoon the warm chocolate filling into a piping bag fitted with a small plain nozzle. Make sure you pipe the chocolate filling while it's still warm. If it cools down too much, it will set and be difficult to work with. Insert the nozzle into the doughnut and gently squeeze in the filling. Serve right away.

343	adjudicated	pos	Brownies: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line the baking pan with aluminum foil, letting it hang about two inches over the sides. Coat the inside of the foil with nonstick baking spray. Place both chocolates and the butter together in the top of a double boiler over low heat. Stir often with a rubber spatula to help melt evenly. Remove the top pan of the double boiler and wipe the bottom and sides dry. Or place the chocolates and butter in a microwave-safe bowl and melt on low power for 30-second bursts. Stir with a rubber spatula after each burst to make sure it's melting. Let the mixture cool while mixing the rest of the brownie batter. Stir with a rubber spatula occasionally to prevent a skin from forming on top. Whip the eggs and egg yolk in the bowl of an electric stand mixer using the wire whip attachment, or in a large bowl using a hand-held mixer, until frothy, about 1 minute. Add the sugars to the eggs and whip together until the mixture is very thick and pale colored and holds a slowly dissolving ribbon as the beater is lifted, about 5 minutes. Add the vanilla and stir to blend well. Add the chocolate mixture to the egg mixture and blend completely on low speed. Stop and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with the rubber spatula. The mixture will be smooth and dark chocolate colored. In a medium bowl, sift the flour and cocoa powder together. Add the salt and stir to combine. In 3 stages, add the dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture, blending well after each addition. Stop and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to help mix evenly. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use a rubber spatula to spread it evenly. Bake for 35 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out with slightly moist crumbs clinging to it. Remove the pan from the oven and cool completely on a rack. Stir the caramel sauce until it is smooth. Pour it onto the top of the cooled brownies and spread evenly into the corners using a small offset spatula.

350	adjudicated	pos	Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with two layers of parchment paper. In a large bowl, thoroughly whisk the flours, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Make a well in the center and pour the cream into it (set the measuring cup aside) and add the grated frozen butter. Use a rubber spatula to push the dry ingredients from the sides of the bowl into the well, cutting and turning the mixture just until the dry ingredients are almost entirely moistened and the dough looks rough and shaggy. Gather the dough into a ball and knead it gently against the sides of the bowl five or so times, pressing loose pieces into the dough, until it just holds together (it should not be smooth) and the bowl is fairly clean. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and pat into a circle about 3/4-inch thick. Using the biscuit cutter or an overturned glass, and re-patting the dough as needed, cut the dough into 8 even rounds. Place them at least 1 inch apart on the baking sheet. Brush the tops with the cream left in the bottom of the measuring cup or with a little milk, and sprinkle generously with turbinado sugar. Bake the shortcakes until the tops are just barely golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Immediately transfer to a wire rack to cool. Set a medium saucepan with 2 cups water over high heat and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, add tea bags, and let steep 3 minutes. Remove tea bags and add apricots, honey, and vanilla bean. Return to stove and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat; cook until the apricots are soft and the liquid has reduced to a thick syrup, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove vanilla bean. Meanwhile, in the chilled bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or using a medium mixing bowl and a handheld electric mixer or a whisk, whip the cream, adding the sugar as it begins to thicken. Continue beating until it holds a soft shape—not too stiff. (The cream can be covered and refrigerated for up to several hours. If liquid separates from the cream, whisk briefly before using.) To assemble the shortcakes, gently pull each shortcake apart horizontally into two equal halves. Place the bottom halves on serving plates. Top each with a generous scoop of apricot compote (about 2 tablespoons) and a dollop of whipped cream. Cover with the tops of the biscuits and serve.

Add kale by the handful, turning and stirring with tongs and adding more kale as volume in skillet reduces. When all of kale is wilted, sauté with 1/2 teaspoon salt until just tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool to room temperature. 3Toss kale with kohlrabi and pistachios.
354	adjudicated	pos	Coarsely chop cauliflower and pulse in a food processor until about the size of grains of rice (or, you can very finely chop with a knife instead). You should have about 2 cups. Heat oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook cauliflower, stirring often, until golden brown all over and charred in spots, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat; season with salt and pepper. Let cool in skillet. Mix yogurt, mint, and lemon juice in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Season lamb shanks very generously all over with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Working in 2 batches, cook lamb shanks in a single layer, turning occasionally, until browned all over, 8–12 minutes per batch. As the shanks finish cooking, transfer to a large plate. Reduce heat to medium; add onions and garlic, cut side down, to the same pot and cook, tossing onions occasionally, until onions are browned in spots and garlic is golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add cinnamon and crushed coriander and cook, stirring constantly, until spices are very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add harissa paste and cook, stirring often and scraping bottom of pot, until vegetables are coated and paste is slightly darkened in color, about 2 minutes. Add 7 cups water, stirring to release any bits stuck on bottom of pot. Season generously with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Return lamb shanks to pot and bring stew back up to a simmer. Cover with a lid, leaving slightly askew so steam can escape, and cook, adjusting heat to maintain a very gentle simmer and skimming foam from surface as needed, until meat is tender and easily pulls away from bones, 1 1/2–2 hours. Transfer lamb shanks to a cutting board and let cool 10–15 minutes; keep liquid at a simmer. Pull meat from bones and tear into bite-size pieces. Add bones back to pot as you go. Transfer meat to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Simmer bones in broth, uncovered, until liquid is thick and very flavorful, 25–30 minutes. Remove from heat; add meat back to pot and let cool uncovered (bones and all) until no longer steaming. Cover pot and chill stew at least 12 hours (you can skip this step, but it will dramatically improve the flavor). Uncover stew and spoon off half to three-quarters of fat on the surface; discard. Gently reheat stew until barely simmering. Pluck out and discard bones. Taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed. Ladle stew into bowls and serve with Toasted Cauliflower Crumbs, Mint Yogurt, harissa, and olives, mint leaves, and/or preserved lemon as desired. Yogurt can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.

Remove foil and turn on broiler, then broil 4 to 6 inches from heat until cheese is browned, 4 to 7 minutes.
396	adjudicated	neg	Toss plums, cocktail onions, lemon juice, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a large bowl. Add arugula, season with salt and pepper, and toss again. Transfer to a platter; top with Parmesan and drizzle with more oil.
397	adjudicated	pos	In a blender, combine all of the ingredients and process until smooth.
398	adjudicated	pos	Toast cumin in a dry small heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant and a shade darker, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl. Add pumpkin seeds to skillet and heat, stirring constantly, until slightly puffed (be careful not to brown them), 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer seeds to a small bowl and stir in 1/4 teaspoon oil and salt to taste. Whisk together cumin, vinegar, chile, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in large bowl, then gently toss with tomatoes, melon, and cilantro. Sprinkle with pumpkin seeds.
399	adjudicated	pos	Muddle ginger and cloves in a measuring glass. Add tea and 1 cup boiling water and stir 10 seconds. Let steep 4 minutes. Meanwhile, fill a mug with hot water to warm it. When tea mixture is ready, pour out hot water, then add rum, cognac, and honey to mug. Strain tea through a fine-mesh sieve into mug and stir to combine. Add lemon juice, then drop lemon wedge into mug. Let sit 1 minute before drinking.
400	adjudicated	pos	Preheat oven to 300°F. Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring often, until milk solids begin to brown, about 6 minutes (do not burn). Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl. Chill until just firm, about 30 minutes. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat brown butter and powdered sugar in a large bowl until pale and creamy, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low and gradually beat in flour and salt, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, just to blend (do not overwork dough). Transfer dough to a sheet of parchment. Form dough into a rectangle. Place second sheet of parchment over dough. Roll out dough to a 8x6" rectangle about 1/2" thick. Remove top sheet of parchment. Transfer dough on parchment to a rimmed baking sheet. Using a fork, pierce dough all over, spacing 1" apart. Bake shortbread, rotating halfway through, until golden brown and firm to the touch, 55–65 minutes. Cut shortbread lengthwise into 1" strips on baking sheet while still warm. Cut each strip crosswise into thirds. Let cool completely. Cookies can be made 2 days ahead; cover and store at room temperature.
401	adjudicated	pos	Place all of the ingredients except the dill in an 8-quart stock pot and add about 3 quarts of cold water to cover. Set over high heat and bring to a boil, skimming any froth that rises to the surface. Turn the heat down to low, set the cover ajar, and simmer for about 2 hours. Add the dill and continue simmering an additional 45 minutes. Turn off the heat, cool to room temperature, and strain through a fine sieve. Refrigerate. If you can prepare the soup a day or two in advance, it will taste even better. Skim off any fat that coagulates on the surface and reserve the fat for the matzo balls. A few hours before serving, prepare the matzo balls. In a large pot, bring the strained soup to a simmer. In a large bowl, beat together the eggs, soup (or water), chicken fat, and salt. Beat in the matzo meal and refrigerate, uncovered, for 1 hour. Bring about 5 quarts of water to a boil with 1 1/2 tablespoons Kosher salt dissolved in it. Remove the matzo meal mixture from the fridge. Wet your hands with cold water and gently shape about 2 tablespoons of the mixture into a sphere by rolling it around in the palms of your hands. Try not to compact the ball too much. Note that the matzo balls will swell to more than double their size when cooked. Add the rolled matzo balls to the boiling salted water and repeat with the remaining mixture. Bring the water back to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to a simmer, tightly cover the pot, and cook for about 40 minutes until the matzo balls are floating on the surface, puffed, and snowy white. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the matzo balls to the hot soup. Keep warm until you are ready to serve.
402	adjudicated	pos	Use a food processor or an electric mixer with a paddle attachment to work the butter, icing sugar, flour, vanilla seeds and salt until the mixture just forms a ball of dough. It takes a while to come together, so don’t lose faith. Once it has formed, turn the dough out onto the work surface. Divide into two pieces and shape each one into a log – I prefer to make it rectangular but it is tasty in any shape. Mix the sumac and sugar on the work surface. Roll the log in the sumac-sugar to coat all over, then place in the fridge to set for at least 1 hour (or freeze it until you want to bake them). Heat your oven to 190°C/170°C fan/375°F/gas mark 5. Line two baking trays with baking paper. Use a sharp knife to cut each log into 12–14 slices and place them flat on the trays. Bake for 10–12 minutes until light golden, then remove from the oven. Leave to cool on the tray before eating.
403	adjudicated	pos	Chill 4 coupe glasses in freezer. Bring sugar and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Cover and chill simple syrup until cold, at least 1 hour. For each cocktail, combine 1 egg white, 2 oz. rye whiskey, 1 oz. lemon juice, and 3/4 oz. simple syrup into a cocktail shaker and shake vigorously (without ice) until mixture is starting to get frothy. Fill shaker with ice and shake vigorously until outside of shaker is frosty and cocktail is frothy, about 20 seconds (yes, a full 20 seconds). Rinse a chilled coupe glass with Pernod; discard. Strain cocktail through a fine-mesh sieve into glass.
404	adjudicated	pos	Preheat the oven to 450˚F. Place a wire rack on a baking sheet lined with foil, and set it aside. Put the flour in a shallow dish. Put the panko in another shallow dish. In a medium bowl, whip the egg whites until they are very foamy but not quite holding peaks. Dredge the steaks in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip them in the egg whites to coat. Then dredge the steaks in the panko, coating them evenly. Place the steaks on the wire rack and spray them with cooking spray. Season the steaks with salt and pepper to taste, and roast until they are golden brown and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick saute pan over high heat. When the pan is hot, add the sausage and stir it to break it up. Cook the sausage until it is just done about 4 minutes. While the sausage is cooking, whisk the chicken broth into the cornstarch in a small bowl. Add the cornstarch mixture to the sausage and bring it to a simmer. When the gravy has thickened slightly (after about 2 minutes), remove the pan from the heat. Stir the yogurt into the gravy. Season it with salt and pepper to taste. Pour the hot gravy over the steaks, and serve immediately.
405	adjudicated	pos	Using the side of a chef’s knife, mash anchovies, if using, and garlic on a cutting board until a smooth paste forms. Transfer paste to a large bowl and whisk in lemon juice, mustard, and a big pinch of salt. Add egg yolk (or mayonnaise) and whisk until smooth. Gradually add oil, whisking constantly until emulsified. Whisk in 3 Tbsp. grated Parmesan. Trim woody ends from broccoli stems, preserving as much stem as possible. Peel any thick stems to expose tender inner cores. Cut off florets as close to the dark green flowers as possible and break into bite-size pieces. Add to bowl with dressing. Starting at the floret ends of the stems, slice very thinly crosswise and add to bowl. Thinly slice cabbage crosswise (you should have about 2 cups) and add to bowl with broccoli. Toss until broccoli and cabbage are combined and evenly coated with dressing; season with salt. Let sit 10 minutes. Top salad with shaved Parmesan, some lemon zest, and a few healthy grinds of pepper. Dressing can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.
406	adjudicated	pos	Pulse pistachios in a food processor until coarsely ground. Add flour, salt, and sugar and pulse to combine. Add butter and pulse just until a coarse meal forms. With motor running, gradually stream in 1/2 cup ice water and process until dough comes together. Transfer dough to a work surface; form into a ball, then flatten into a disk. Wrap in plastic and chill at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400ºF. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a small skillet over medium-low. Cook leek, stirring occasionally, until softened but without taking on any color, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Mix goat cheese, cream, and garlic in a medium bowl to combine; season with salt and black pepper. Divide dough into 4 pieces. Roll out 1 piece of dough on a lightly floured surface to an 8" round; transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Using an offset spatula, spread one-quarter of goat cheese mixture over dough, leaving a 1" border. Scatter 1 Tbsp. dill evenly over, then top with a thin layer of potato slices. Drizzle with oil; season with salt. Scatter one-quarter of leeks over potatoes. Fold edges of dough over filling, tucking and overlapping slightly as needed. Repeat with remaining dough, goat cheese mixture, chopped dill, potatoes, and leeks and more oil and salt to make 3 more galettes. Brush top of dough with egg. Bake galettes until crusts are golden brown and potatoes are soft, 30–40 minutes. Drizzle with honey and top with dill sprigs. Sprinkle with pink peppercorns, if using; season with salt and black pepper. Dough can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
407	adjudicated	pos	Cut broccoli rabe into 3-inch-long pieces. Cook in a large pot of boiling salted water (3 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water), uncovered, until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, then rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Squeeze out excess water from handfuls of broccoli rabe. Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Broil sausage in a 4-sided sheet pan 3 to 4 inches from heat, turning occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Keep warm, covered. While sausage broils, heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook garlic, stirring, until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Separate broccoli rabe, then sauté in garlic oil until coated with oil and heated through, about 4 minutes. Stir in sausage.
408	adjudicated	pos	Stir together the pork, bacon, molasses, smoked paprika, brown sugar, salt, sage, and black pepper until well combined. Heat up a skillet over medium heat and cook a small spoonful of the sausage for a couple of minutes on each side. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if necessary. Once you're satisfied with the flavor balance, refrigerate the mixture for an hour for the flavors to come together. To cook the sausage, form it into 2-inch-wide, 1/4-inch-thick patties and fry over medium-high heat until both sides are brown and crisp, 5 minutes per side. The sausage will keep in the refrigerator for a week uncooked, and it can also be frozen uncooked for 3 months.
409	adjudicated	pos	Place pork shoulder on a rimmed baking sheet. Season with 1 tablespoon each kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Cover pork with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 400°F. Heat a large heavy pot (such as a Dutch oven) over high; add 1/4 cup oil, onion, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables start to sizzle; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, herbs, and spices and sauté for 1 minute more. Add the wine and bring to a simmer. Place the pork on top of the aromatics and add enough stock or water to come halfway up the pork. Bring liquid to a simmer, and then cover pot with a lid or a couple layers of foil. Transfer pot to oven and cook for 10 minutes; reduce heat to 325°F and cook until the meat is quite tender, about 3 hours. (To test for doneness, insert a slender, sharp knife into the middle of the roast; it should pull out easily.) When meat is cooked, transfer it to a separate container, reserving the pan juices. Set a colander over a large bowl, and strain the pan juice into the bowl, pressing on the solids to extract all the liquid. Let strained pan juices until fat rises to the top, about 5 minutes. With a small ladle, skim off and discard the fat. Pour the skimmed, strained pan juices over the pork and let cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate overnight. One hour before you're ready to serve the pork, remove the meat from its cooking liquid and cut (while still cold) into neat 1-inch slices; set aside. Pour cooking liquid in a medium saucepan; bring to a simmer and reduce by a third. Season to taste, cover, and keep warm. While your pork comes to room temperature, prepare the salsa verde. Line a large plate with a paper towel, and place it next to the stove, alongside a slotted spoon or "spider" spatula. In a small skillet, heat 1/2 inch of vegetable oil over medium heat. When the oil starts to look swirly, drop in a single rosemary leaf to test for readiness: if it sinks quietly to the bottom, the oil's not ready. When a leaf sizzles, but not in a frantic way, you are ready to fry. Add the rosemary leaves to the oil and fry until the sizzling subsides, about 1 minute. Using the slotted spoon or spider, scoop the herbs from the oil and place the on the paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat with the sage leaves in the same oil; remove skillet from heat. On a cutting board, gather the parsley leaves into a ball, holding them down on the cutting board as if they were trying to run away. Slice this parsley bundle thinly, as if it were a single vegetable. As you slice, the ball will come apart, but just bunch it back together as best you can, keep slicing, and you'll have a nice head start on the chopping that remains. Anchor the tip of the knife to the cutting board and use a paper cutter-like motion to chop away at your pile. Go over it a couple of times, then slide the knife under, like a spatula, and flip it over. Continue chopping and flipping until the parsley is finely chopped; transfer to a medium bowl. Render the garlic a paste by either pounding it in a mortar with a pinch of salt, or with a knife on a cutting board, again with salt. When the garlic is almost a thick liquid, transfer it the bowl with the parsley; add the fried herbs and the olive oil. Stir salsa verde to combine, adding more salt or oil as needed. Heat a grill, grill pan, griddle, or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, coat the grill or pan with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Working in batches and adding more oil as needed, cook until well browned and crispy on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Pour the reduced pan juices onto a serving platter with the pork (but not over the slices or they will lose some crispness) and arrange pork slices on top. Serve with salsa verde spooned over the top, or served alongside.
410	adjudicated	pos	Peel the yam, removing all the dark outer bark. Some tubers have woody bark running to the core in some areas. Remove it, preserving as much flesh as possible. Slice the yam into 3/4 inch discs, halve, then quarter. Put in a pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 8 minutes. Top and tail the plantain, then make a skin-deep incision along the spine. Peel and cut into 4 even pieces, crosswise. Add to the pan of simmering yam and leave for another 8 minutes. Add a little more warm water if the plantain and yam are not sufficiently covered. In the meantime, measure out the coconut oil and seasoning. Check if the yam is done by removing a piece and inserting a fork. If you can do so with relative ease, it’s ready. Yam is robust and can withstand “overcooking,” so don’t worry if any pieces have boiled inconsistently. Check the plantain by removing one piece and halving it crosswise on a cutting board. You want each piece to be the same bright yellow as the outside through the cross section. When both yam and plantain are ready, drain in a colander and return them to the dry pan. Working quickly, add the coconut oil and mash thoroughly while hot. It usually takes 2 to 3 minutes to achieve a smooth consistency. Season with the salt and white pepper and mash one last time. I like to use a fork for this part. Ball with an ice cream scoop and serve immediately.
411	adjudicated	pos	Grind the peppercorns and mix with the salt and thyme leaves. Rub the beef lightly with some of the olive oil, then rub the pepper mixture all over the beef. Heat a ridged cast-iron grill pan until very hot. Put the beef in the pan and sear on all sides, then remove from the pan and let cool. Use a long, sharp knife to slice the beef as thinly as possible. Place the slices on a board and press them with the flat side of the knife blade to flatten each slice and make it bigger. Cover the serving plates with the beef. Season, then drizzle with half the lemon juice. Toss the salad leaves and sprouts with some olive oil and a little more lemon juice. Scatter the leaves over the beef, then shave the cheese on top. Drizzle with a little more olive oil and serve with the lemon wedges.
412	adjudicated	pos	Whisk together milk, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan. Add herb sprigs and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Gently boil, whisking constantly, 1 minute. Lightly beat yolks in a large bowl. Pour hot milk mixture through a sieve into a large glass measure, pressing gently on sprigs before discarding, then gradually add to yolks, whisking until combined. Cook mixture in saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until thick enough to coat back of spoon and registers 170 to 175°F on thermometer, 3 to 5 minutes (do not let boil). Pour custard through cleaned sieve into a clean bowl and cool completely, its surface covered with wax paper. Chill until cold, at least 2 hours. Freeze custard in ice cream maker. Transfer ice milk to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.
413	adjudicated	pos	Preheat oven to 425°F. Place beets in a shallow baking dish and add water until it reaches about 1/2" up the sides of the beets. Cover with foil, crimping edges to make a tight seal. Bake beets until a skewer poked through foil easily pierces flesh, 65–75 minutes. Remove from oven, uncover, and let sit until cool enough to handle. Using paper towels (if you have gloves, wear them to keep your hands stain-free), rub skins to remove; discard. Lightly crush beets with the flat side of a chef’s knife, then tear into bite-size pieces and place in a large bowl. Heat oil, spices, and bay leaves in a small skillet over medium and cook, swirling often, until oil is sizzling around spices and spices are fragrant, about 3 minutes. Pour over beets, add vinegar, and toss to combine. Season with salt. Let cool. Beets can be marinated 5 days ahead. Cover and chill.
414	adjudicated	pos	Whisk oil, vinegar, shallot, salt and pepper in a bowl. Set aside. Cook asparagus in simmering water until soft but still crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Rinse under cold water and drain. Wrap a strip of ham around each asparagus stalk. Toss frisée, greens and grapes with dressing in a bowl, then transfer to a platter; top with asparagus. Garnish with almonds.
415	adjudicated	pos	Mix first 7 ingredients in medium glass bowl. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. (Sauce can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place carrot in medium bowl. Cover with ice water. Let stand 15 minutes, then drain well. Brush fish on all sides with 2 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until just opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add shallot; stir 1 minute. Add tatsoi; sprinkle with salt. Toss until tatsoi is wilted but still bright green, about 2 minutes; divide among 4 plates. Place fish atop tatsoi. Sprinkle each fillet with carrot; drizzle each with 2 tablespoons sauce. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.
416	adjudicated	neg	In the Instant Pot, combine the butternut squash, a pinch each of salt and pepper, and the olive oil. Set to “sauté, medium heat” and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes, stirring often to avoid burning. Add the onion and bell pepper and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the paprika, chili powder, rosemary, and garlic and toss to combine. Hit “cancel.” Make 2 wells in the hash and crack the eggs into the wells. Cover, choose the “egg” setting, and cook for 1 minute. Quick-release the pressure and serve.
417	adjudicated	pos	Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325°F. Lightly oil muffin cups. Blend together all pudding ingredients in a blender until smooth, then divide batter among muffin cups. Stir together sugar and cornstarch in a 9- to 10-inch glass or ceramic pie plate. Add rhubarb and toss to coat, then spread in one layer. Bake puddings and rhubarb, side by side, carefully turning rhubarb over once halfway through cooking, until puddings are just set and edges are pale golden, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove puddings and rhubarb from oven at the same time. Set rhubarb aside and cool puddings in muffin pan on a rack 5 minutes (puddings will sink slightly). Run a thin knife around edge of each pudding, then invert a platter over pan and invert puddings onto platter. Transfer puddings, right side up, to plates and serve topped with rhubarb and its juices.
418	adjudicated	pos	Preheat oven to 450°F. Roast bones on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet 30 minutes. Arrange celery, onion, and carrots on sheet; roast 10 minutes. Spread tomato paste over bones and vegetables and roast 5 minutes more; let cool. Meanwhile, heat oil in a small saucepan over medium and cook garlic, shaking pan occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl; set aside garlic. Set aside oil for Ditalini Risotto and other uses. Transfer bones and vegetables to a large pot; pour in cold water to cover. Add herb stems, bay leaves, peppercorns, coriander seeds, and reserved garlic. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer, skimming fat and foam from surface, until caramel colored and flavorful, about 3 hours. Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing on solids; discard solids. Stock can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.
419	adjudicated	pos	Trim off the tough bottom of the spear by grasping each end and bending it gently until it snaps at its natural point of tenderness—usually two-thirds of the way down the spear. If the spear is less than 6 inches long, chances are it has already been trimmed for you. Alternatively, you can cut the ends off with a knife. Coat each spear with olive oil by placing clean, dry spears in a resealable plastic bag, pour in the oil, and massage spears to coat each one. Sprinkle with salt and massage again. Leave the asparagus in the bag until ready to cook. Place on the cooking grate crosswise so it won't fall through. Grill for 10 to 15 minutes (depending on the size and thickness of the stalks), turning occasionally to expose all sides to the heat. Asparagus should begin to brown in spots (indicating that its natural sugars are caramelizing) but should not be allowed to char. Remove from grill and serve immediately—eating spears with your fingers enhances the experience.
420	adjudicated	pos	Melt butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add leeks and stir to coat. Cover and cook until leeks are golden brown, stirring every 5 minutes, about 20 minutes total. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over medium heat before using.) Combine 1/2 cup milk and garlic in medium saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium-low heat. Reduce heat to very low, cover, and cook until garlic is soft, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Using back of fork, mash milk-garlic mixture to paste. Set aside. Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain well. Return potatoes to same pot; mash until almost smooth. Add mascarpone and milk-garlic mixture; mash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand uncovered at room temperature. Rewarm over medium-low heat, stirring and thinning with milk by 1/4 cupfuls if dry.) Top with leeks. *Italian cream cheese; sold at many supermarkets and at Italian markets. If unavailable, blend 3/4 cup cream cheese with 3 tablespoons whipping cream and 1 1/2 tablespoons sour cream.
421	adjudicated	pos	In glass or small bowl, combine agave nectar and water, and stir until combined. In cocktail shaker filled with ice, combine tequila, agave nectar mixture, and lime juice. Shake vigorously, then strain into old-fashioned glass filled with fresh ice.
422	adjudicated	pos	Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray 13 x 9 x 2-inch metal baking pan with nonstick spray. Line bottom of pan with long strip of 9-inch-wide parchment paper, leaving overhang on both short sides of pan. Whisk flour and salt in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until creamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in sugar. Continue beating until mixture is light and fluffy, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl, about 3 minutes. Beat in vanilla, then egg yolk. Gradually add flour mixture, beating on low speed just to blend. Drop dough by tablespoonfuls into prepared baking pan, spacing evenly. Using moistened fingertips, press dough to form even layer over bottom of pan. Pierce dough all over with fork. Bake cookie base until light golden brown and slightly puffed and edges begin to come away from sides of pan, about 30 minutes. Place pan on rack; immediately sprinkle bittersweet chocolate over. Let stand until chocolate softens, about 3 minutes. Using small offset spatula, spread bittersweet chocolate over top of cookie in thin even layer. Immediately sprinkle chopped peppermint candies over. Stir white chocolate in medium metal bowl set over saucepan of simmering water until melted and smooth. Remove from over water. Using fork, drizzle white chocolate all over cookies. Chill until white chocolate is set, about 30 minutes. Using paper overhang as aid, lift cookie from pan and transfer to work surface. Using large knife, cut cookie into irregular pieces. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Store in refrigerator in airtight containers between layers of waxed paper or parchment paper. For a variation on this cookie, sprinkle the melted dark chocolate with chopped peanut brittle or peanut butter cups instead of the peppermint candies.
423	adjudicated	pos	1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F/175°C. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. If using parchment paper, lightly coat it with vegetable oil or cooking spray. 2. With an electric mixer, beat together the confectioners' sugar, dark brown sugar, butter, and peanut butter until smooth. Beat in the vanilla. 3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat the flour mixture into the peanut butter mixture a small amount at a time. 4. Using a 1-tablespoon/15-milliliter measuring spoon or equal capacity ice cream scooper, scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, placing each cookie about 1 1/2 inches/4 centimeters apart. Roll the dough between your palms and make a dip with your thumb in each. Fill each dip with 1/2 teaspoon jam or jelly. 5. Bake the cookies until light golden, about 15 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through the baking time. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and cool completely before serving.
424	adjudicated	neg	Position rack in top third of oven and preheat to 425°F. Toss tomatoes, 1 Tbsp. oil, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until tomatoes start to blister, about 13 minutes. Place bread, cut side up, on another rimmed baking sheet and bake 5 minutes. Remove from oven and rub cut sides with garlic. Dollop ricotta on cut sides of bread. Top evenly with tomato mixture, then sprinkle with Parmesan. Bake until Parmesan melts, about 10 minutes. Whisk pesto and remaining 2 tsp. oil in a small bowl until smooth. Drizzle on pizzas and season with salt and pepper.
425	adjudicated	pos	Put a 17-by 11-inch heavy 4-sided sheet pan in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 475°F. Toss chicken with 1 tablespoon oil and season with a slightly rounded 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Place chicken, skin side down, to one side in hot sheet pan. Toss plum tomatoes, celery, and potato with remaining 2 tablespoon oil and spread in empty side of pan in 1 layer, without crowding. Season vegetables with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Roast 20 minutes. Turn chicken over and roast chicken and vegetables 15 minutes more. Scatter grape tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, and olives over vegetables in pan. Drizzle water over vegetables, then roast until chicken is golden and cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes more. Serve chicken with vegetables.
426	adjudicated	pos	Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350°F. Cook bacon in very large pot over medium-high heat until brown but not yet crisp, stirring often, 8 to 10 minutes. Add smoked sausage, andouille, and tasso. Sauté until meats start to brown in spots, about 10 minutes. Add onions, celery, and bell peppers. Cook until vegetables begin to soften, stirring occasionally, 10 to 12 minutes. Mix in chicken. Cook until outside of chicken turns white, stirring often, 5 to 6 minutes. Mix in paprika, thyme, chili powder, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. Cook 1 minute. Add diced tomatoes with chiles and broth; stir to blend well. Add more cayenne, if desired. Mix in rice. Bring jambalaya to boil. Cover pot. Place in oven and bake until rice is tender and liquids are absorbed, 45 to 48 minutes. Uncover pot. Mix chopped green onions into jambalaya; sprinkle jambalaya with chopped parsley and serve.
427	adjudicated	pos	Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toast nuts and seeds and oats on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl; let cool. Meanwhile, mix egg, butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl; let sit until nuts are cool (this will make for a chewier cookie). Add dried fruit and chocolate to nut mixture; toss to combine. Give egg mixture a good stir, then stir in flour. Mix in nut mixture, smashing it against the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, until combined and mix-ins are evenly coated in dough. (It will look like too many mix-ins, but dough will come together as it chills.) Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 3 days. Reheat oven to 350°F. Using a ⅓-cup measure or #16 cookie scoop, portion out dough, packing firmly, to make 12 cookies. Divide between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets as you go. Using measuring cup or your hand, press cookies into 2½"-diameter disks about ¾" thick; sprinkle with sea salt. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back once, until golden brown and no longer wet-looking, 11–13 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Do Ahead: Cookies can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
428	adjudicated	pos	Divide meat into 8 portions (about 4 oz. each). Place 1 portion on a work surface. Cup your hands around the meat and shape it into a rounded mound. Gently flatten patty to about 3/4" thick. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining portions of meat. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat.

469	adjudicated	pos	Mix onion, garlic, ginger, gochujang, soy sauce, sugar, mirin, sesame oil, and 1 tsp. pepper in a medium bowl to combine; set sauce aside. Toss rice, cumin, garlic powder, and mustard powder in a medium bowl to combine; spread out on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and chill until cold, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, season chicken generously with salt. Heat butter and vegetable oil in a medium heavy pot over medium. As soon as foaming subsides, add chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add reserved sauce and bring to a simmer; cook until sauce appears to thin out, about 3 minutes. Add broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, partially cover pot, and simmer, turning occasionally, until chicken is very tender, 45–55 minutes. Divide rice into 4 portions; form into 3/4"-thick disks (moisten hands with water to prevent sticking). Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium. Working in 2 batches, cook rice cakes, turning halfway through, until crisp, puffed, and golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer to plates. Add scallions to chicken and cook until tender, about 3 minutes.

470	adjudicated	pos	In a large saucepan cover dried beans with triple their volume of cold water. Bring water to a boil and cook beans, uncovered, over moderate heat 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and soak beans 1 hour.
471	adjudicated	pos	Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Butter a 9- by 2-inch round cake pan. Whisk together flours, wheat germ, salt, sugar, baking soda, and cream of tartar in a large bowl until combined well. Blend in butter with a pastry blender or your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Make a well in center and add buttermilk, stirring until a dough forms. Gently knead on a floured surface, adding just enough more flour to keep dough from sticking, until smooth, about 3 minutes. Transfer dough to cake pan and flatten to fill pan. With a sharp knife, cut an X (1/2 inch deep) across top of dough (5 inches long). Bake until loaf is lightly browned and sounds hollow when bottom is tapped, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 10 minutes, then turn out onto rack and cool, right side up, about 1 hour.
472	adjudicated	pos	Add 2 ounces gin (preferably Tanqueray) to a highball glass filled with ice. Squeeze in 1-3 lime wedges to taste, then add them to glass. Add 3-4 ounces tonic water; stir to combine.
473	adjudicated	pos	Whisk cocoa, sugar, salt, and 1 2/3 cups flour in a medium bowl. Add butter and toss to coat. Using your fingers, smash butter into dry ingredients until it nearly disappears (you shouldn’t see any large bits) and mixture holds together when squeezed—you’re working it more than you would pie dough. Make a well in the center and add yolk and milk. Using a fork, gradually incorporate flour mixture until you’ve got a shaggy dough. Knead a couple of times in bowl until no dry spots remain and dough is smooth. Flatten into a 3/4"-thick disk, wrap tightly in plastic, and chill until firm, about 2 hours. (You can make the caramel filling during this time.) Preheat oven to 350°F. Let dough sit 5 minutes to soften slightly. Roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 14" round about 1/8" thick, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Lift dough on one edge and throw a pinch of flour on surface. Slide bottom of tart pan under dough, positioning it roughly in the center. Fold in edges of dough so it’s resting fully on insert; place inside tart ring and unfold edges so they gently slump against sides of pan and excess dough is hanging over the edges. Press dough firmly into bottom of pan with floured hands, then use a straight-sided measuring cup to firmly press sides of dough into grooves and up sides of pan. Roll pin over top edge of pan to shear off excess dough flush with pan. Reserve dough scraps for patching any potential cracks later. Prick bottom of dough all over with a fork and chill in freezer until very firm, 10–15 minutes. Place tart pan on a rimmed baking sheet and line with a sheet of parchment paper or foil. Fill with pie weights or dried beans and bake until edges of crust are set and starting to look dry, 12–15 minutes. Carefully lift parchment with weights. Patch any visible cracks with reserved dough. Return crust to oven and bake until firm and dry all over, 18–22 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool. Bring sugar, cream of tartar, and 1/3 cup water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-low, stirring with a heatproof spatula until dissolved. Cook, swirling pot often but not stirring, until mixture turns deep amber and wisps of smoke rise from the surface, 8–10 minutes. Remove caramel from heat and immediately stir in butter a piece at a time until smooth (be careful; mixture will sputter). Gradually stir in cream, then add salt. Transfer caramel to a heatproof measuring glass (you should have about 1 1/2 cups). Let cool until warm. Pour caramel into cooled tart shell. Chill until caramel is set, at least 1 hour. Place chocolate, cream, and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (bowl should not touch water). Stir with a heatproof spatula until ganache is smooth, about 5 minutes. Let cool until thickened enough to hold an indentation from a spoon. Remove tart from refrigerator and scrape ganache over caramel. Using a spoon, gently work ganache over surface, creating decorative swooshes and swirls. Sprinkle with sea salt; let sit until ganache has lost its sheen, 10–15 minutes. Dough can be made 2 days ahead; keep chilled. Crust can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature. Caramel filling can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill. Microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring in between, just until pourable. Caramel-filled tart can be made 1 day ahead; once it’s set, cover and keep chilled. Tart can be assembled 1 day ahead. Chill until ganache is set, then cover loosely. Let sit at room temperature 15 minutes before slicing.
474	adjudicated	pos	Preheat convection oven to 425°F or regular oven to 450°F with rack in middle. Pat meats dry, then rub with 2 1/2 teaspoons salt (total) and arrange in 1 layer in a large shallow baking pan with quartered onions and halved carrots. Roast, turning occasionally, until meats and vegetables are well browned, 35 to 45 minutes in convection oven; 45 minutes to 1 hour in regular oven. Transfer meats and vegetables to pot with any juices from pan. Deglaze pan with a little water, scraping up brown bits, then add to pot with water (6 quarts) and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer, skimming foam and fat from surface. Tie celery, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns, and clove in a cheesecloth bundle and add to pot. Cut off dark green part from leeks, reserving remainder, and wash . Fold greens and tie in 2 bunches, then add to pot. Gently simmer, uncovered, skimming as necessary, until meats are very tender, about 3 hours. Trim roots from leeks, keeping ends intact, then, starting 1 1/2 inches from root end, slit each leek lengthwise and wash between layers. Tie leeks together in 2 bunches, tying each bunch in 2 places. Blanch boiling onions in a medium pot of boiling water 1 minute, then drain and peel. Preheat oven to 200°F with rack in lower third. Transfer meats to a shallow baking pan, discarding bones from short ribs, and keep warm, covered with foil, in oven. Discard cheesecloth bundle, leek greens, and cooked onions and carrots from broth, then skim off fat from broth with a skimmer or large spoon and keep broth warm over low heat. Arrange marrowbones (if using) upright in 1 layer in a medium saucepan and add enough broth from pot (about 1 quart) to cover bones. Add 1 teaspoon salt and simmer gently, uncovered, until marrow is soft, 15 to 20 minutes. While marrowbones cook, simmer boiling onions and leeks with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in remaining broth in large pot, uncovered, 15 minutes. Add small carrots and turnips and simmer, uncovered, until all vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer marrowbones with tongs to a platter (discard liquid) and serve with baguette slices and coarse salt. Discard bone from chuck roast and slice chuck 1/2 inch thick, then arrange, along with meat from short ribs, on a large platter. Transfer vegetables to platter with a slotted spoon and cut string off leeks. Season broth with salt and pepper, then spoon some over meats and vegetables to moisten and serve remainder in a soup tureen. To eat, ladle broth over meats and vegetables in soup plates, then stir in horseradish and mustard to taste.

478	adjudicated	pos	Boil the spaghetti in salted boiling water, according to the package directions. Meanwhile, using a Microplane, grate the zest from the lemon into a large mixing bowl. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the bowl (I like to use the grater as a strainer—one less thing to clean). Add the 1 1/2 cups Parmesan, pepper, and a pinch of salt, and mix in the olive oil to form a wet paste. When the spaghetti is perfectly cooked, add 2 or 3 tablespoons of the cooking water to the lemon and cheese mixture. Add the spaghetti to the bowl and toss thoroughly, adding another tablespoon or 2 of pasta water if necessary so that the sauce coats each strand. Roughly tear in the basil leaves. Serve each portion with a sprinkle of coarse salt, a fresh grind of black pepper, and a few gratings of extra Parmesan.

Cook pasta in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water, until al dente, then drain in a colander. Return pasta to pot, then stir in parmesan cream and prosciutto, tossing to coat. Transfer mixture to a 2-quart shallow flameproof gratin or baking dish (about 11 by 8 by 2 inches; not glass) and bake 15 minutes. Stir pasta well to coat evenly with sauce, then sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons cheese. Turn on broiler and broil pasta 4 to 5 inches from heat until top is lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes.
481	adjudicated	pos	1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400˚F. Brush the insides of 12 to 14 muffin cups with softened butter, then brush the top of the pan. 2. Sift the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt together into a medium bowl. Beat the butter in the bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on high speed until creamy, about I minute. Gradually beat in the sugar and continue beating, scraping the sides of the bowl often with a silicone spatula, until the mixture is very light in color and texture, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in the eggs. Reduce the mixture speed to low. Beat in the pumpkin; the mixture may look curdled. In thirds, beat in the flour mixture, scraping down the sides of the bowl often, and mix until smooth. Add the raisins. Increase the speed to high and beat until the batter has a slight sheen, about 15 seconds, no longer. 3. Using a 2 1/2 inch-diameter ice-cream scoop, portion the batter, rounded side up, into the prepared cups. Sprinkle the tops with the sunflower seeds. 4. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F and continue baking until the tops of the muffins are golden brown and a wire cake tester inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 15 minutes more. 5. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove the muffins from the pan and cool completely.
482	adjudicated	pos	Whisk together cream, milk, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a 2 1/2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil over moderate heat, whisking occasionally, then boil, whisking, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in remaining ingredients. Transfer to a bowl and chill, uncovered, until cold, at least 1 hour. Freeze in ice cream maker, then transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden, at least 2 hours. Soften gelato slightly in refrigerator, about 20 minutes, before serving.
483	adjudicated	pos	Pour 4 cups water, the salt, and the olive oil into the saucepan, and gradually whisk in the chickpea flour until smooth. Set over medium heat, and whisk constantly as the batter slowly heats. It will thicken and eventually steam but does not need to boil. Cook and keep whisking, scraping the bottom and sides of the pan frequently, until the mixture is quite stiff and starts to pull away from the sides as you stir it, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn the batter into the oiled pan, and spread it quickly with the spatula, before it cools and sets, so it fills the pan in an even layer. Wet the spatula with water, and smooth the top of the batter. Let cool for an hour or longer, until completely firm. Cut pieces with a sharp knife, in whatever size or shape you like and in the amount you need. I cut 1 1/2-inch squares for appetizers and Sicilian-style sandwiches; 2-by-3-inch bars—at least two per person—to accompany a main course. Lift the cut pieces from the pan with a spatula (seal the remainder with plastic wrap and refrigerate for longer keeping). To fry the panelle, pour enough extra-virgin olive oil into the heavy skillet to cover the bottom with 1/8 inch of oil, and set over medium heat. When the oil is hot, lay in the panelle, leaving plenty of space between them. Fry about 3 minutes, until the underside is crisp and golden, then flip them over and brown the second side, about 2 minutes more. Set the panelle on paper towels to drain and cool for a minute, but serve while they are still warm (though they taste good at room temperature too!).
484	adjudicated	pos	Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium. Cook onion and thyme, stirring often, until onion is translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Add potato and cook, stirring occasionally, until potato surfaces look chalky, about 2 minutes. Add broth, bring to a boil, and cook until potato is tender, 8–10 minutes. Stir in greens, peas, and sugar, remove from heat, and let sit 10 minutes to allow greens to soften. Purée soup in a blender until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Serve soup topped with crème fraîche and herbs.
485	adjudicated	pos	1. Grease the baking sheet with the 1 teaspoon butter, and set it aside on a heatproof surface. 2. Combine the sugar, chocolate, evaporated milk, and heavy cream, in a large (6- to 8-quart) saucepan or stockpot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, uncovered and without stirring. 3. Once the mixture has come to a boil, insert the candy thermometer. Add the corn syrup, and stir gently with the heatproof spatula until everything is mixed well. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often and making sure to scrape the bottom of the pot to keep the mixture from burning, until the mixture reaches 230°F/110°C (thread stage), about 30 minutes. 4. Add the 3 1/2 tablespoons butter and, stirring continuously, cook the caramel until it reaches 238°F/115°C (soft ball stage), 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the caramel from the heat. 5. Stir in the salt, making sure to mix well so that it's distributed evenly. Wearing oven mitts, carefully pour the caramel onto the prepared baking sheet. Allow it to cool completely until it's firm to the touch, at least 3 hours, preferably overnight. (If it's humid, cover the caramel with plastic wrap until you can cut it and wrap it in wax paper.) 6. Lightly coat a sharp chef's knife with cooking spray, and run the tip around the edge of the baking sheet to release the caramel. Gently turn the caramel out onto the lined cutting board, and cut it into 1-inch squares. Wrap the pieces in wax twisting paper (to turn the squares into little logs, fold each piece over on itself, wrap the twisting paper around it and roll the wrapped caramel against the cutting board, then twist the ends of the paper shut). Store the caramels in an airtight container at cool room temperature for up to 4 weeks; they'll last for up to 3 months in the refrigerator.

487	adjudicated	pos	In chilled cocktail shaker or pint glass, stir together vermouth, gin, Maraschino liqueur, bitters, and ice until well combined. Strain into chilled coupe glass. Twist lemon peel over glass, drop into drink, and serve.
488	adjudicated	pos	1. Pour the cream and milk into a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (the bottom of the bowl should not touch the water). Whisk in 1/2 cup (100 grams) of the sugar and the salt and stir until they have dissolved. Warm the mixture until you see steam rising from the top. 2. Meanwhile, prepare an ice bath in a large bowl and set another bowl over it. Set aside. 3. In a medium bowl, with a kitchen towel underneath it to prevent slipping, whisk together the egg yolks with the remaining 2 tablespoons (25 grams) sugar until uniform. While whisking, add a splash of the hot dairy mixture to the yolks. Continue to add the dairy mixture, whisking it in bit by bit, until you've added about half. Add the yolk mixture to the remaining dairy mixture in the double boiler. Set the heat under the double boiler to medium and cook the custard, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon and reducing the heat to medium-low as necessary, until steam begins to rise from the surface and the custard thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally and run your fingers through the custard. If the trail left by your finger stays separated, the custard is ready to be cooled. 4. Strain the custard into the bowl sitting over the prepared ice bath and stir for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the custard has cooled. Transfer the custard to a quart-sized container, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or, preferably, overnight. 5. Add the mint extract to the chilled custard. Pour the custard into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place the container in which you refrigerated the custard in the freezer so you can use it to store the finished ice cream. Churn the ice cream until the texture resembles "soft serve." In the last minute of churning, fold in the chocolate chips and churn until incorporated. Transfer the ice cream to the chilled storage container and freeze until hardened to your desired consistency. Alternatively, you can serve it immediately—it will be the consistency of gelato. The ice cream will keep, frozen, for up to 7 days.

496	adjudicated	pos	Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Cut the dough into 10 evenly sized pieces (about 3 ounces each) and roll each into a ball. Cover with a kitchen towel and let them rest for about 15 minutes. Line 2 baking sheets with nonstick baking mats or parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 400°. Make sure your figures are very distinct; otherwise the shape will be lost in the oven as the breads rise. Use very little to no flour on the work surface. You need the dough to stick slightly to the countertop. Roll each ball into a log about 6 inches long. To form the head, about 1 to 1 1/2-inches in from one end, press down with the edge of your hand. Roll your hand back and forth. A neck will form and the head above it. Taper the body so it's wider at the shoulders and narrower toward the feet. Pat the body down to flatten it. With a sharp knife or with sharp scissors, make a single cut to form the legs and pull them apart. (Dipping the blades in water helps them cut more cleanly.) Make 2 diagonal cuts beginning at about the waist and angling in and up to below the shoulders. Pull the arms out. After that you can play, perhaps making a hat or muffler from scraps. Transfer the breads to the baking sheets, cover with kitchen towels, and let them rise for about 30 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks with 1 teaspoon of water. With a pastry brush, brush the breads with the egg wash. Press the raisins or other decorations firmly into the breads to make eyes, noses, buttons, and other details as your imagination prompts. Bake the breads for about 20 minutes or until dark golden brown. Let them cool on a rack. You can leave the breads glossy from the egg-yolk glaze or give them a sugar glaze. In a small bowl, mix the powdered sugar with just enough water to make a brushable paste, about 1 tablespoon. Brush the glaze all over the breads while they are still warm. Serve them the same day you bake them.
